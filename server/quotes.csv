Sleep is that golden chain that ties health and our bodies together.;Thomas Dekker;health
Building a new Health and Hospitals Network is fundamental to building a stronger and fairer Australia.;Kevin Rudd;health
The Australian Government's decision to take on the dominant funding role for the entire public hospital system is designed to: end the blame game eliminate waste and to shoulder the funding burden of the rapidly rising health costs of the future.;Kevin Rudd;health
If the states and territories do not sign up to fundamental reform, then my message is equally simple: we will take this reform plan to the people at the next election - along with a referendum by or at that same election to give the Australian Government all the power it needs to reform the health system.;Kevin Rudd;health
These are important reforms. Infrastructure, education, health, hospitals, closing the gap with indigenous Australians. Also the Apology to the first Australians. As Prime Minister of the country I am proud of each and every one of these achievements.;Kevin Rudd;health
I am in very good health. I've never felt better.;Hugh Hefner;health
I'm always active in trying to educate people when it comes to eating animal products, testing on animals, and the health benefits of being vegan, although I'm probably not the best person to be talking about the latter at the moment.;Daniel Johns;health
I'm against big bureaucracy in Washington making health care decisions. I just have an aversion to bureaucrats. But it's not just government bureaucrats. I don't like HMO bureaucrats and insurance company bureaucrats either.;Gary Bauer;health
And under the existing circumstances, I understand there are situations where people indeed need care and need services, but I believe in America that the majority of those people are getting those services under situations and circumstances that are afforded to them by their health care providers and their state government.;Jan Brewer;health
We have over 500,000 illegal immigrants living in Arizona. And we simply cannot sustain it. It costs us a tremendous amount of money of course in health care, in education, and then, on top of it all, in incarceration. And the federal government doesn't reimburse us on any of these things.;Jan Brewer;health
The truth is I had lots of rehab and now I have a clean bill of health.;Samantha Morton;health
I am passionate about talking to women about their breast health.;Elizabeth Hurley;health
When you start fooling around with drugs, you're hurting your creativity, you're hurting your health. Drugs are death, in one form or another. If they don't kill you, they kill your soul. And if your soul's dead, you've got nothing to offer, anyway.;Paul Stanley;health
Do you suppose there is any living man so unreasonable that if he found himself stricken with a dangerous ailment he would not anxiously desire to regain the blessing of health?;Petrarch;health
I believe in health care reform.;Joe Manchin;health
In my forties, my optimism was boundless. I had really good health and tremendous success which allowed me to do anything I wanted.;Patricia Cornwell;health
Better understanding of the natural world not only enhances all of us as human beings, but can also be harnessed for the better good, leading to improved health and quality of life.;Paul Nurse;health
I have health. I have a wonderful support system. I have the admiration of millions of strangers, which I do not underestimate.;Kathleen Turner;health
I basically believe the medical insurance industry should be nonprofit, not profit-making. There is no way a health reform plan will work when it is implemented by an industry that seeks to return money to shareholders instead of using that money to provide health care.;Dianne Feinstein;health
When you get older, your health becomes important to you, things start breaking down, you've always got a different ache or pain.;Tom Petty;health
Aaron Pryor wants to get into the ring with me. He wants to be able to retire, and he will. For health reasons.;Sugar Ray Leonard;health
You bet every member of Congress who votes for this bill ought to read it, read it thoroughly, and understand that what we're looking at here amounts to nothing more than a government takeover of our health care economy, paid for with nearly a trillion dollars in new taxes on individuals and small businesses. And it must be opposed.;Mike Pence;health
Most of the State of the Union will not be about Iraq. Most of the State of the Union will be about improving America's economy and providing greater access to health care for millions of American people, including senior citizens.;Ari Fleischer;health
I believe you need scientific proof that something works before you entrust your health to it.;Britt Ekland;health
There is much that public policy can do to support American entrepreneurs. Health insurance reform will make it easier for entrepreneurs to take a chance on a new business without putting their family's health at risk. Tort reform will make it easier to take prudent risks on new products in a number of sectors.;Eric Ries;health
Here in Silicon Valley, I have taken part in hundreds of conversations trying to convince people to dive in and become entrepreneurs. All too often, innovators with good, safe, jobs are unwilling to put their family's access to health care at risk by walking away from company-backed medical insurance.;Eric Ries;health
Balance is key: I need to be successful in my career to feel fulfilled, be surrounded by people I care about to share it with, and have my health to be able to do the things I love to do!;Kiana Tom;health
The voice collects and translates your bad physical health, your emotional worries, your personal troubles.;Placido Domingo;health
When elected officials abandon our environment and ruin our natural resources, public health is endangered. I know the importance of providing a clean environment for our children I have attended more than one funeral for a child who has died from an asthma attack.;Gwen Moore;health
The fact is, if our primary legislative goals are to repeal and replace the health spending bill to end the bailouts cut spending and shrink the size and scope of government, the only way to do all these things it is to put someone in the White House who won't veto any of these things.;Mitch McConnell;health
When women earn the money for the family, everyone in the family benefits. We also know that when women have an income, everyone wins because women dedicate 90% of the income to health, education, to food security, to the children, to the family, or to the community, so when women have an income, everybody wins.;Michelle Bachelet;health
We simply can no longer afford to deny the full potential of one half of the population. The world needs to tap into the talent and wisdom of women. Whether the issue is food security, economic recovery, health, or peace and security, the participation of women is needed now more than ever.;Michelle Bachelet;health
As a doctor, when I was minister of health and would go somewhere, little girls would come up to me and say, 'I want to be like you one day, I want to be a doctor.' Now, they tell me, 'I want to be president just like you.' All of us can dream as big as we want.;Michelle Bachelet;health
Advances in science and medical research and public health policies have meant that life expectancy for Australians is one of the highest in the world.;Julie Bishop;health
I'm active in PAX, which is a gun awareness organization. We treat gun safety as a public health issue.;Mandy Patinkin;health
When the courts decide that murderers, rapists, and others who maliciously break our social contract deserve health care that most working Americans can't afford, they are condemning good people to death.;Tammy Bruce;health
We are all ill: but even a universal sickness implies an idea of health.;Lionel Trilling;health
You may keep your beauty and your health, unless you destroy them yourself, or discourage them to stay with you, by using them ill.;William Temple;health
Economists are coming to acknowledge that measures of national wealth and poverty in terms strictly of average income tell you little that is significant of the health or viability of a society.;Rowan D. Williams;health
In sharp contrast to the idea that this stage of life is enviable, we hear high levels of anxiety about getting old, anxieties about health, mobility, access to facilities, simple routine care and attention.;Rowan D. Williams;health
The answer was that in Burundi, having a clean bill of health has taken on a very particular meaning: unless and until you have paid for your hospital treatment, you simply can't leave, you are in effect a captive.;Rowan D. Williams;health
People take the mickey out of mental health, but it is very delicate.;Frank Bruno;health
Over 120 Aboriginal communities run their own health services - some have been doing so for 30 years. They struggle with difficult medical problems. They also try to deal with counselling, stolen generations issues, family relationships, violence, suicide prevention.;Malcolm Fraser;health
I'm actually tougher on myself as I get older. It's a vicious cycle. The things that are important in life are the things that you can't buy in life: love, health and happiness. I say that, and I believe that, and I try to live that.;Criss Angel;health
My health is good and it's up to me to keep it that way.;Charles Kennedy;health
I want to see far more decisions taken far closer to the patients, the passengers and the pupils. Far more power for locally and regionally elected politicians who understand best the needs of their areas. And far more say too for the dedicated staff at all levels in health and education.;Charles Kennedy;health
I should do something about the cigarettes I quite accept that it's bad for your health, but you know a moderate tipple is positively beneficial and, at certain times, absolutely essential.;Charles Kennedy;health
These are the same people who believe, in some cases, the federal government should not play any role in providing health care to our people or protecting the environment.;Bernie Sanders;health
People don't trust private health insurance companies for all the right reasons.;Bernie Sanders;health
If the goal of health-care reform is to provide comprehensive, universal health care in a cost-effective way, the only honest approach is a single-payer approach.;Bernie Sanders;health
As a single-payer advocate, I believe that at the end of the day, if a state goes forward and passed an effective single-payer program, it will demonstrate that you can provide quality health care to every man, woman and child in a more cost-effective way.;Bernie Sanders;health
Look, if you have somebody who doesn't have health insurance, who doesn't have a doctor or dentist, and in order to deal with their cold or flu or dental problem, they go to an emergency room - in general, that visit will cost ten times more than walking into a community health center.;Bernie Sanders;health
I believe that investing in our children's development from the earliest age is the single most important contribution we can make to the health and wellbeing of our citizens, their capacity and the future prosperity of our state.;Jay Weatherill;health
As I go to sleep I remember what my father said-that one can never be sure if one will awake. The way my health is now, this is becoming more and more real.;Jerzy Kosinski;health
I think that everyone is saying all kinds of things about 'rich.' Not only am I rich from doing some of things I've been able to do, but I'm rich in spirit. I'm rich in health. I'm rich in every way possible.;NeNe Leakes;health
Like it or not, in the end, it's one's body. It's literally what carries you through life. There's a reason for the saying, 'If you have your health, you have everything,' and it's true. Old age, disease - these are the great equalizers.;Candace Bushnell;health
The Supreme Court has never ruled that Congress can use the Commerce Clause to require individuals to engage in an activity they have chosen to avoid. Yet that is precisely what Obamacare does: It forces Americans without health insurance to purchase coverage. Such a requirement is unprecedented and unconstitutional.;John Cornyn;health
In other words we have marketed our way into this health crisis.;Frank Shorter;health
So I can't show you how, exactly, health care is a basic human right. But what I can argue is that no one should have to die of a disease that is treatable.;Paul Farmer;health
If any country was a mine-shaft canary for the reintroduction of cholera, it was Haiti - and we knew it. And in retrospect, more should have been done to prepare for cholera... which can spread like wildfire in Haiti... This was a big rebuke to all of us working in public health and health care in Haiti.;Paul Farmer;health
You can't have public health without a public health system. We just don't want to be part of a mindless competition for resources. We want to build back capacity in the system.;Paul Farmer;health
When I ran for Congress I promised to help make health care affordable again.;Bobby Jindal;health
My background is in health care.;Bobby Jindal;health
I know the exploding cost of health care is at the root of our long-term fiscal challenges.;Fred Upton;health
Prior to passage of Obamacare, Americans spoke out against the individual mandate they didn't want to change the health care they had they didn't want a 3,000-page bill that empowered 15 Washington bureaucrats to decide the future of the doctor-patient relationship.;Fred Upton;health
Americans want and deserve a broad array of health insurance choices so they can identify those that best fit their own individual or family needs. These choices expand when we allow free enterprise to foster innovation, not smother it with taxes and one-size fits all ideology.;Fred Upton;health
Under President Obama's new health care law, Medicaid will become a very different health coverage program than first envisioned.;Fred Upton;health
Originally created to serve the poorest and sickest among us, the Medicaid program has grown dramatically but still doesn't include the kind of flexibility that states need to provide better health care for the poor and disadvantaged.;Fred Upton;health
The national debate on health care once centered on improving access to quality care, yet the effect of Obamacare will be the exact opposite, resulting in the shameful degradation of care for the neediest individuals.;Fred Upton;health
Obamacare is a seriously flawed law that makes health care coverage less affordable, costs taxpayers more than advertised and fails to deliver on most of its other grand promises.;Fred Upton;health
Giving governors more leeway in administering health care could represent a small, positive development in the ongoing saga of Obamacare. Unfortunately, instead of choosing flexibility, President Obama and his left-leaning advisers always default to rigid 'Washington knows best' answers.;Fred Upton;health
The real truth is that the Obama administration is professional at bullying, as we have witnessed with ACORN at work during the presidential campaign. It seems to me they are sending down their bullies to create fist fights among average American citizens who don't want a government-run health care plan forced upon them.;Jon Voight;health
Money spent on carbon cuts is money we can't use for effective investments in food aid, micronutrients, HIV/AIDS prevention, health and education infrastructure, and clean water and sanitation.;Bjorn Lomborg;health
We are losing our living systems, social systems, cultural systems, governing systems, stability, and our constitutional health, and we're surrendering it all at the same time.;Paul Hawken;health
I am actually in poor health due to chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome, and my ability to work is greatly diminished right now, so I have to get better before I can start another big project.;Laura Hillenbrand;health
I am now almost certain that we need more radiation for better health.;John Cameron;health
The way I feel today, as long as my health is good and I can handle myself well and people still come to my concerts, still buy my CDs, I'll keep playing until I feel like I can't.;B. B. King;health
Exercise keeps me occupied, which is good for my mental health.;Gail Porter;health
By adopting a wonderful mutt, you'll save a life and help reduce animal homelessness while also boosting your chances of a more robust new furry friend, as mixed-breed dogs have demonstrated better health and longer life spans than their purebred cousins.;Ingrid Newkirk;health
People are ready to say, 'Yes, we are ready for single-payer health insurance.' We are the only industrialized country in the world that does not have national health insurance. We are the richest in wealth and the poorest in health of all the industrial nations.;Studs Terkel;health
That's why I wrote this book: to show how these people can imbue us with hope. I read somewhere that when a person takes part in community action, his health improves. Something happens to him or to her biologically. It's like a tonic.;Studs Terkel;health
Everyone should have health insurance? I say everyone should have health care. I'm not selling insurance.;Dennis Kucinich;health
I believe health care is a civil right.;Dennis Kucinich;health
I have worked to expand the health care debate beyond the current for-profit system, to include a public option and an amendment to free the states to pursue single payer.;Dennis Kucinich;health
In the past week it has become clear that the vote on the final healthcare bill will be very close. I take this vote with the utmost seriousness. I am quite aware of the historic fight that has lasted the better part of the last century to bring America in line with other modern democracies in providing single payer health care.;Dennis Kucinich;health
Order is the sanity of the mind, the health of the body, the peace of the city, the security of the state. Like beams in a house or bones to a body, so is order to all things.;Robert Southey;health
I would like to be as fit as I've always been. I've been blessed with good health, I've been blessed with stamina. Particularly for those great classical roles, you need an Olympian stamina. I, fortunately, have that.;Derek Jacobi;health
The issues that matter to me are the social safety nets for people, health care, middle-class concerns. We need to take care of the middle class and the poor in our country.;Tim McGraw;health
We will always make sure player health and safety is our No. 1 priority in the NFL.;Roger Goodell;health
The fact is if we do our job right, if we keep worrying not about polls but about the jobs of the American people, about their health care, about their ability to educate their kids, stay in their homes and own their homes, send their kids to college, the basic pillars of a middle-class life, if we keep worrying about the future and building a stronger future for this country, these things will take care of themselves.;David Axelrod;health
I think that the millions and millions of young Americans, young Americans, who have health care today, who wouldn't have had it if the president hadn't acted are better off.;David Axelrod;health
My father was a small-town banker. He became very ill when I was 10 years old, and we went to California three years later in an attempt to recover his health, which never happened.;Warren Christopher;health
My hobbies include maintaining my physical and mental health. It's a full-time job. Yoga definitely helps for both of them. I'm a big fan of relaxing and not having a schedule. That's my best way to keep from going crazy.;Olivia Thirlby;health
It became obvious in 1957 that I was endangering my health by carrying so much weight.;Kate Smith;health
As an integral part of the Department of Agriculture, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service monitors our Nation's agriculture to protect against agricultural pests and diseases.;Mike Rogers;health
Nurses are an integral component of the health care system, and it is important that we recognize the over 2.7 million registered nurses for the significant work that they do.;Nathan Deal;health
Well, you know my number one cause has always been that women's reproductive health needs to be protected.;Ann Richards;health
I work very hard on my health, and I think about it, of course, like I've never thought before.;Ann Richards;health
In mid-May, the House of Representatives approved the full amount of money that the Veterans Administration said was needed for next year - plus an additional $1 billion increase for veterans' health care.;Doc Hastings;health
Years ago nobody was elected on the economic ticket. It was either the education platform, or it was health or it was other issues. It is only recently that economic values have superceded every other human value.;Anita Roddick;health
I think there's a lot of work to be done with our societies. My biggest passions are the environment and health. And when I say 'health' I mean the secrets behind health and our food system.;Shailene Woodley;health
Studies have shown that inmate participation in education, vocational and job training, prison work skills development, drug abuse, mental health and other treatment programs, all reduce recidivism, significantly.;Bobby Scott;health
We are particularly interested in the mental health programs and policies that support our troops and their families before, during, and after deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan.;John M. McHugh;health
The minute health care becomes a huge, unwieldy, expensive government bureaucracy it's a permanent feature of life and there's nothing anyone can do about it.;Mark Steyn;health
There's definitely evidence that capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior. When you look at the worst corners of the American health insurance industry or the sub-prime banking market, it really feels like the more psychopathically someone behaves, the more it's rewarded.;Jon Ronson;health
There should not be one new dime in tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires as long as millions of children in America are poor, hungry, uneducated and without health coverage.;Marian Wright Edelman;health
It was very clear to me in 1965, in Mississippi, that, as a lawyer, I could get people into schools, desegregate the schools, but if they were kicked off the plantations - and if they didn't have food, didn't have jobs, didn't have health care, didn't have the means to exercise those civil rights, we were not going to have success.;Marian Wright Edelman;health
The U.N. Population Fund has a maternal health program in some Cameroon hospitals, but it doesn't operate in this region. It's difficult to expand, because President Bush has cut funding.;Nicholas D. Kristof;health
Neither left nor right has focused adequately on maternal health.;Nicholas D. Kristof;health
Health care comprises nearly 20 percent of our national economy, but outdated bureaucracy and red tape have stifled competition and raised costs. As a result, today more than 45 million are without any health coverage.;John Shadegg;health
I really believe that beauty comes from health - sensible eating and exercise.;Dita Von Teese;health
Third issue, and again I think it is important to note, anyone can make a mistake and any administration can make a mistake once in a while, but this is just a long train of abuses, an unbroken chain of following special interests rather than the health of the American people.;Jay Inslee;health
Challenges of historic import threaten America's future. Action on the deficit, economy, energy, health care and much more is imperative, yet our legislative institutions fail to act. Congress must be reformed.;Evan Bayh;health
Everybody likes Johnny Cash. I think the sad part of it is his health is givin' him problems.;Merle Haggard;health
I am hopeful for the American people that we can actually improve the outlook for bringing down costs in health care.;Eric Cantor;health
We've had Town Hall meetings, we've witnessed election after election, in which the American people have taken a position on the President's health care bill. And the bottom line is the people don't like this bill. They don't want it.;Eric Cantor;health
You know, there are people making a lot of money in this country who can actually afford their own health care. We are in a situation where we got a safety net in place in this country for people who frankly don't need one. We got to focus on making sure we got a safety net for those who actually need it.;Eric Cantor;health
Finally, the ecological health of the Mississippi River and its economic importance to the many people that make their living or seek their recreation is based on a healthy river system.;Ron Kind;health
As founder and co-chair of the upper Mississippi River Congressional task force, I have long sought to preserve the river's health and historical multiple uses, including as a natural waterway and a home to wildlife, for the benefit of future generations of Americans.;Ron Kind;health
Nor is it the least advantage to health, accruing from such a way of life, that it expose those who follow it to fewer temptations to vice, than persons who live in crowded society.;William Falconer;health
The best advice is to avoid foods with health claims on the label, or better yet avoid foods with labels in the first place.;Mark Hyman;health
Because what happens is, as the economy suffers, tax revenues go down. But unlike businesses, where at least your variable costs go down, in government your variable costs go up: unemployment insurance, workmen's compensation, health care benefits, welfare, you name it.;Meg Whitman;health
It has pleased and interested me to see how I could get along under difficult circumstances and with so much discomfort but as I say I was not sent out here to improve my temper or my health or to make me more content with my good things in the East.;Richard H. Davis;health
We each have a personal myth, a vision of who we really are and what we want. Health means that part of what you want is to give to others.;George Weinberg;health
I understand that in these difficult economic times, the potential for any additional expense is not welcomed by American businesses. But in the long run, the health insurance reform law promises to cut health-care costs for U.S. businesses, not expand them.;Gary Locke;health
The concern right now is that families are paying for insurance, or getting insurance from their employer and trusting that health care will be available for their families. In too many instances now, the care they need isn't available.;Debbie Stabenow;health
I think that we have a number of different health care challenges in our country, and certainly addressing the uninsured is one, and the second is making sure that those with health insurance actually get the care that they assume they'll have available to them if they get sick.;Debbie Stabenow;health
The Patients' Bill of Rights is necessary to guarantee that health care will be available for those who are paying for insurance. It's a part of the overall health care picture.;Debbie Stabenow;health
When I turned 30, due to my father's heart history and my family genetics, I vowed to start seeing a cardiologist every year and just really be proactive and take my own heart health into my own hands.;Jennie Garth;health
I want to encourage everyone to be proactive with their health and get checked out.;Giuliana Rancic;health
During my nearly five years as director-general of WHO, high-level policymakers have increasingly recognized that health is central to sustainable development.;Gro Harlem Brundtland;health
Health is the core of human development.;Gro Harlem Brundtland;health
Intervention for the prevention and control of osteoporosis should comprise a combination of legislative action, educational measures, health service activities, media coverage, and individual counselling to initiate changes in behaviour.;Gro Harlem Brundtland;health
Since the reduction of risk factors is the scientific basis for primary prevention, the World Health Organization promotes the development of an integrated strategy for prevention of several diseases, rather than focusing on individual ones.;Gro Harlem Brundtland;health
That the AIDS pandemic is threatening sustainable development in Africa only reinforces the reality that health is at the center of sustainable development.;Gro Harlem Brundtland;health
Women's health is one of WHO's highest priorities.;Gro Harlem Brundtland;health
This is a historic moment in global public health, demonstrating the international will to tackle a threat to health head on.;Gro Harlem Brundtland;health
This syndrome, SARS, is now a worldwide health threat... The world needs to work together to find its cause, cure the sick and stop its spread.;Gro Harlem Brundtland;health
When they favor the access of other people to education and health care, the countries of the North not only demonstrate generosity or solidarity, but also implement the principles of respecting and promoting human rights.;Omar Bongo;health
I don't think it's government's job to find health care for people. I think it's the individual's job to find health care.;Ted Cruz;health
I think the first and principle objective is to repeal Obamacare before it does lasting, fundamental damage to our health care system, to our individual liberty, to the relationship each of us has with his or her doctor.;Ted Cruz;health
My motivation has always been health - eating healthy and taking care of myself.;Gabrielle Reece;health
With a lot of hair and make-up then I'm possibly, remotely attractive. But it's rare, I don't think I'm ugly but I'm nothing particularly special. I'm not a yoga and health girl. I don't exercise that much and I eat crap and smoke and bite my nails.;Lisa Marie Presley;health
I retire with a smile on my face, in good health, and ready to spend autumns at my kids' games instead of my own. I'm excited to start the next chapter of my life.;Drew Bledsoe;health
The majority of Americans receive health insurance coverage through their employers, but with rising health care costs, many small businesses can no longer afford to provide coverage for their employees.;Jim Ryun;health
Skyrocketing insurance premiums are debilitating our Nation's health care delivery system and liability insurers are either leaving the market or raising rates to excessive levels.;Jim Ryun;health
In turn, more physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers are severely limiting their practices, moving to other states, or simply not providing care.;Jim Ryun;health
American families, families back home in Minnesota, know only too well that out-of-pocket expenses for health care have been rising at an astonishing rate.;Jim Ramstad;health
America's veterans deserve the very best health care because they've earned it.;Jim Ramstad;health
The Recovery plan will put money in the pockets of the American worker, create and save millions of new jobs and invest in crucial areas such as health care, education, energy independence and a new infrastructure.;Valerie Jarrett;health
For those that are working part time, in small businesses, or who are unemployed and do not currently have health insurance, we want to make sure that you are covered.;Valerie Jarrett;health
One of the major goals of health insurance reform is to bring down the cost.;Valerie Jarrett;health
We want to make sure that we incentivize the health care system to be designed to provide you the best quality health care possible.;Valerie Jarrett;health
Please be assured that as we move along through the implementation of health insurance reform, making sure that we find efficiencies within the existing system, is foremost on the President's mind.;Valerie Jarrett;health
President Obama stands ready to work with everyone, because that's what the American people expect and deserve - not for the short term political advantages, but the long term health of our country. We don't spend time trying to figure out what's in the minds of Republicans, we try to keep our focus on the American people.;Valerie Jarrett;health
I turned into a workaholic to the point of where my health was in jeopardy.;Tab Hunter;health
Health care costs blunt the competitive edge of American entrepreneurs, from the auto industry to internet start-ups.;Tom Allen;health
By giving every American access to quality, affordable health care, they will create a more competitive, a stronger and more secure America!;Tom Allen;health
To do what we are doing in this budget to our children, cutting their health care funds, decreasing opportunity, simply so we can pay for tax cuts and a war in Iraq is beyond belief, and we need to reverse it.;Tom Allen;health
I'm committed to universal health coverage and education.;Carol Moseley Braun;health
When you're young, you don't think very far ahead. You just think in terms of the next day, the next week, the next competition. You don't think about injuries that could threaten your long-term health.;Katarina Witt;health
I don't work out and be healthy and want a strong body because I want to look good in a bikini. I do all of those things for me and for my health. I'm not going on the cover of 'Maxim' and 'FHM' because that's not me.;Maggie Q;health
What you see is when the government gets involved, you run out of money and health care gets rationed.;Rick Scott;health
If you can eat 70 percent raw or introduce raw into your diet, it will help your health.;Carol Alt;health
We all recognize that in recent decades, many important achievements have helped create a cleaner, healthier environment, yet our national needs in environmental health are not being fully met.;Samuel Wilson;health
America's health care system provides some of the finest doctors and more access to vital medications than any country in the world. And yet, our system has been faltering for many years with the increased cost of health care.;Paul Gillmor;health
The lack of health care coverage has remained very important to me during my time in Congress and as a member of the House Subcommittee on Health, I am working hard with my colleagues to correct these inequalities.;Paul Gillmor;health
The American economy has always been driven by the entrepreneurial nature of its citizens, and blocking access to affordable health care will only suffocate growth within the small business sector of our economy.;Paul Gillmor;health
The World Health Organisation has a lot of its medical experts sitting in Geneva while hospitals in Africa have no drugs and desperate patients are forced to seek medication on the black market.;Pauline Hanson;health
I've never had any health problems and I'm Ruben, man, all the way through.;Ruben Studdard;health
I never want to try to be a spokesperson for health and wellness because I most definitely am not the most in shape person in the world.;Ruben Studdard;health
Health and education are always issues.;Helen Clark;health
Some of the best health care services are free or cost very little and are even available to millionaires but hardly anyone knows they exist.;Matthew Lesko;health
There are few in America that really know how to take advantage of the current health care system.;Matthew Lesko;health
Family, nature and health all go together.;Olivia Newton-John;health
When my friends have a health concern, they call me. I've always been a vitamin taker. I also take digestive enzymes and antioxidants, and supplements that help with the thyroid and adrenals for my time-zone changes.;Carla Gugino;health
People really do make the assumption that I had some weirdo Hollywood upbringing, but my parents are incredibly down-to-earth people who worked really hard to raise us in a way that was health.;Zoe Kazan;health
And whether it is equal pay, health care, Social Security, or family leave, this Congress has refused to address issues critical to hard-working American women.;Louise Slaughter;health
Contraceptives have a proven track record of enhancing the health of women and children, preventing unintended pregnancy, and reducing the need for abortion.;Louise Slaughter;health

While most Americans have access to the best oral health care in the world, low-income children suffer disproportionately from oral disease.;Michael K. Simpson;health
Recent demonstration projects have shown that with some Federal support, a little funding can go a long way toward ensuring that low-income children have access to good oral health care.;Michael K. Simpson;health
Fear is a question: What are you afraid of, and why? Just as the seed of health is in illness, because illness contains information, your fears are a treasure house of self-knowledge if you explore them.;Marilyn Ferguson;health
In the midst of these hard times it is our good health and good sleep that are enjoyable.;Knute Nelson;health
Science is the international language, so when we are able to convince countries that good decision-making for human health and animal health is based upon science, that's a real success story for us.;Mike Johanns;health
I've always believed fitness is an entry point to help you build that happier, healthier life. When your health is strong, you're capable of taking risks.

Who is there that ever receives a gift and tries to make bargains about it? Let us, then, return thanks for what He has bestowed on us. Who can tell whether, if we had had a larger share of ability or stronger health, we should not have possessed them to our destruction.;Alphonsus Liguori;health
Having good health, being able to breathe and be happy, that's one of the most beautiful gifts. On top of that, I have the gift to play music and make people happy through that. I'm just telling you from my heart, I'm so in love with life.;Roy Ayers;health
Do you know what the overhead is of the Medicare system? One-point-zero-five percent. Do you know what - private insurance is 30 percent in overhead and profits? Given a choice how I'm going to improve health care, I'm going to take it away from private insurance profits and overhead. Wouldn't you?;Anthony Weiner;health
What I am saying is, all health care has a problem with costs. Medicare is growing slower than the private insurance plans. Why? Because of their efficiency. They don't have to give money to shareholders. Why should be defending shareholders?;Anthony Weiner;health
Is Medicare socialism? You want to get rid of Medicare. And a lot of the people against health care do. I want to preserve it and grow it.;Anthony Weiner;health

I believe we can incentivize more affordable health care in general by better regulating insurance and creating meaningful competition for health care services.;Amy Klobuchar;health
I don't think it should be a surprise when we're talking about energy and trying to have more home-grown energy, be less reliant on foreign oil when you look at our health care that we're trying to get more affordable health care, that these are going to create major debates in this country and be somewhat polarizing.;Amy Klobuchar;health

My top three priorities for my first term in Congress are growing our economy providing for quality, affordable health care and keeping our nation and communities safe.;Cathy McMorris;health

Health care is the No. 1 concern of small businesses and the status quo is untenable.;Karen Mills;health
We see tremendous excitement from small-business people about the administration and about the attention and commitment that the president has to do things that really make a difference. I think they recognize that health care is one of those. I think they recognize that what we've been doing in the Recovery Act with our loan programs has mattered.;Karen Mills;health
We don't want the efficiency of the federal government and the compassion of the IRS to run our health care.;Todd Akin;health
The great equalizer is health. If you don't have it, you're screwed.;Jami Gertz;health
The reason Gov. Romney passed Romneycare as governor of Massachusetts in 2006 was because many Republicans viewed health care reform, mandates and all, as a way to inoculate against Democratic charges that Republicans didn't care about people who lacked health insurance.;Ari Fleischer;health
Well, what did we buy? Instead of a leaner, smarter government, we bought a bureaucracy that now tells us which light bulbs to buy, and which will put 16,500 IRS agents in charge of policing President Obama's health care bill.;Michele Bachmann;health
I'm up here in Cleveland tonight and there are a lot of folks who are concerned about it. Twenty-five percent of the people up here get their health care through religious organizations and so that religious freedom issue is very important to them.;Rob Portman;health
Americans oppose Obamacare because they understand that it is inconsistent with our liberties and our idea of limited government and that it will destroy the best health care system in the world.;David Limbaugh;health
And in terms of their crown jewel legislative achievement: who knew that when asked, 'will government impose a new federal mandate requiring middle class Americans to buy health insurance whether they can afford it or not?' The answer would be 'Yes we can!';Artur Davis;health
The more you worry, the more you throw off the delicate balance of hormones required for health.;Andrew Bernstein;health
The truth is that stress doesn't come from your boss, your kids, your spouse, traffic jams, health challenges, or other circumstances. It comes from your thoughts about these circumstances.;Andrew Bernstein;health
Five years ago we were working on a new album when my health began failing.;Lou Gramm;health
America enjoys the best health care in the world, but the best is no good if folks can't afford it, access it and doctor's can't provide it.;Bill Frist;health
I can support co-ops if they want to do it as we've known co-ops in America for 150 years - where they serve the purposes of the consuming public, whether it's health care or whether it's co-ops as we know them in the Midwest, providing electricity or to sell supplies to farmer.;Chuck Grassley;health
Decades ago, women suffered through horrifying back-alley abortions. Or, they used dangerous methods when they had no other recourse. So when the Republican Party launched an all-out assault on women's health, pushing bills to limit access to vital services, we had to ask: Why is the GOP trying to send women back... to the back alley?;Lisa Edelstein;health
It's been a long road back to health and fitness for me. I am just glad to have been given the opportunity to do what I love most.;Jonah Lomu;health

San Francisco businesses face many challenges, including high rents, regulatory burdens, and the rising cost of workers compensation insurance and employee health plans.;Gavin Newsom;health
Not really in all honesty because until you take control of your own health and go to your own doctor and have your own doctor tell you what's going to work for you.;Star Jones;health
It is essential that the women's preventive coverage benefit, including contraception, be available to all women, regardless of what health plan they have or where they work - as Congress intended. Providing access to birth control just makes good sense.;Gwen Moore;health
It is important for women to have a choice, to have an opportunity to plan their families, because if they don't, the Republicans have said this is an ownership society. You are on your own, and they're going to begrudge that child everything, from WIC to a Pell Grant to health insurance.;Gwen Moore;health
Too many of my constituents, like many other hard working Americans across the country, are suffering unnecessarily due to our flawed health care system.;John Conyers;health
The time is now for Congress to address health care in America.;John Conyers;health
Our system of private health insurance that fails to provide coverage to so many of our citizens also contributes to the double-digit health care inflation that is making America less competitive in the global economy.;John Conyers;health
In this most powerful nation in the world, lack of access to health care should not force local and state governments, companies and workers into bankruptcy, while causing unnecessary illness and hospitalization.;John Conyers;health

Working families need to know that we will work to protect their health needs, promote the development of safe, effective medicines, and guarantee patient rights.;Christopher Dodd;health

We need a vibrant Medicaid program and strategies to expand affordable access to health care for all, especially for the specialty care services that community health centers do not provide.;Jan Schakowsky;health
In Illinois, community, migrant, homeless and public housing health centers operate 268 primary care sites and serve close to 1 million patients every year.;Jan Schakowsky;health
Each and every day health centers provide high-quality primary and preventive care to our constituents.;Jan Schakowsky;health
Community health centers do a great deal with limited resources. They provide critical medical care services to many who would otherwise have no other place to go or would end up in an emergency room.;Jan Schakowsky;health
As grateful as we are for all the work the community health centers do, it is also important that we recognize that they cannot solve the health care crisis facing our Nation by themselves.;Jan Schakowsky;health
Therefore in medicine we ought to know the causes of sickness and health.;Avicenna;health
Unfortunately, we are still in an age where individuals may be discriminated against because of health conditions.;Lois Capps;health
Research clearly shows us that the earlier women think about maintaining their bone mass and take the steps to do so, the better their health will be in the long run.;Lois Capps;health
I want to thank the efforts of the American Public Health Association and its 200-plus partners who have organized events around the Nation that serve to raise everyone's awareness of the need to improve public health.;Lois Capps;health
It is great good health to believe, as the Hindus do, that there are 33 million gods and goddesses in the world. It is great good health to want to understand one's dreams. It is great good health to desire the ambiguous and paradoxical.;Clive Barker;health
I know that it isn't just violence against women, it's how do we support ourselves and our families, how do we deal with health care for ourselves and our families? It's a bigger picture.;Patricia Ireland;health

Health care for all Americans is the most pressing domestic issue today. It's far past time for the President and Congress to deliver health care to everyone.;Russ Feingold;health
Well, my view is that the insurance companies have done awfully well and spent a lot of money on a lot of things that don't have anything to do with health care.;Russ Feingold;health

We face a choice this election. President Obama is fighting for changes that grow the economy from the middle out and help all Americans succeed - jobs, education, health reform, the DREAM Act, equal pay for women.

It is time to maximize and prioritize our health care dollars.;Jane D. Hull;health
Of course the EU and member states must work to ensure that people moving from one country to another understand their obligations and their rights in areas like health, road safety and further education.;John Bruton;health
If bringing up the next generation is important, why aren't they the best qualified, the best paid? Why aren't we as concerned about their career progression as we are about those who work in the education or health services?;Estelle Morris;health
Health economists have estimated that an injection of $250 million per year in Indigenous clinical care, and $50 million in preventative care, is required to provide services at the same level as for any other group with the health conditions of Indigenous Australians.;Malcolm Fraser;health

Our health care system is the finest in the world, but we still have too many uninsured Americans, too high prices for prescription drugs, and too many frivolous lawsuits driving our physicians out of state or out of business.;Judy Biggert;health
But I don't want to be out there anymore I don't want people asking me about my health issues, about my kids. I choose not to be a public paparazzi girl on purpose.;Toni Braxton;health
The time to read is any time: no apparatus, no appointment of time and place, is necessary. It is the only art which can be practiced at any hour of the day or night, whenever the time and inclination comes, that is your time for reading in joy or sorrow, health or illness.;Holbrook Jackson;health
We can all agree that no American should lose their life savings or their home because of illness or injury and that the rising cost of health care severely burdens individuals, families and businesses.;Judd Gregg;health
At least Obama was half-way honest about how much he was going to spend on health care. He had it at $600 billion. And the real number... is $1.2 trillion.;Judd Gregg;health
As the GAO report recognizes, the long-term health of our forests relies on additional fuel reduction options and funding to reduce the risks that catastrophic fire poses to our nation's ecosystems, communities and federal budgetary resources.;Greg Walden;health
And what we're doing in Ohio is we're moving from a basic manufacturing economy to one that's diversified, including energy and health care and agriculture and IT.;John Kasich;health
But, at the end of the day, we need to represent the taxpayers who have made enormous sacrifices. Many have lost their jobs. Many of them have seen their companies - they don't have a pension - they have seen their companies cut the match for their 401(k). They have seen their health care benefits be shredded.;John Kasich;health
In addition, California spends nearly $1 billion a year in Medi-Cal services for an average of 780,000 illegal immigrants a month, over and above emergency health services.;Elton Gallegly;health

You know, for most seniors Medicare is their only form of health care.;Corrine Brown;health

I've never followed a vegan or vegetarian diet in the past, but I think I could do it. It would not be easy. I have worked with nutritionists who have said a vegan diet is not necessarily all positive for your health, because you need nutrients you only find in meats. I believe in a balanced diet.;Joel Robuchon;health
Taste is developed by the diversity of the products one can sample. I think our children today may be missing an education about food. We must teach them to know their cuisine and to know the equilibrium of nourishment. That is very important for health.;Joel Robuchon;health
Raising taxes is the last thing we should do amid the weakest economic recovery since World War II. Unfortunately, even if we avoid the full 'Taxmageddon' scenario, President Obama's health care law also contains a new surtax on investment that will take effect in 2013.;John Cornyn;health
By the Obama administration's reasoning, it would be constitutionally permissible to make Americans purchase nearly any product (broccoli, gym membership) that improved their health and thereby contributed to lower health-care costs.;John Cornyn;health
Think for a moment about what Obamacare has done: The federal government has come up with its own (ever-evolving) definition of 'health insurance,' which now includes free access to sterilization, contraception, and certain abortifacients such as the morning-after pill.;John Cornyn;health
If Obamacare is allowed to stand - and Congress is allowed to make the purchase of government-endorsed health insurance compulsory - there will be no meaningful limit on Washington's reach into the lives of the American people. That is certainly not what the Founders intended.;John Cornyn;health
Illegal drug use runs contrary to the image of health depicted by cycling. Distributors of these drugs must be prosecuted more harshly as they are ciminals.;Bernard Hinault;health
The health industry, the fitness industry, was really starting to pick up. This was around the mid 80's.;Warren Cuccurullo;health

I was for civil unions and believed strongly that the flow of benefits and protections that would be provided in a civil union for same-sex couples, the decisions that have to be made, when health hardships are faced, when economic hardships are faced, I wanted all of those protections. I never strayed from them.;Harold Ford;health
You're entitled to Medicaid regardless of your income. Don't worry about your health care.;Max Baucus;health
Every American has a right to affordable, high-quality health care.;Max Baucus;health
Health reform is an essential part of restoring America's economy and maintaining our competitiveness.;Max Baucus;health
But reducing harmful emissions, abating our dependence on foreign oil and developing alternative renewable energy sources have benefits that go beyond environmental health, they improve personal health, enhance national security and encourage our nation's economic viability.;Jim Clyburn;health
Pharmaceutical companies are enjoying unprecedented profits and access with this Administration. Yet the Republicans' prescription drug plan for seniors has been a colossal failure, and over 43 million Americans wake up every morning without health insurance.;Jim Clyburn;health
Democrats believe we must have comprehensive health care reform that includes giving the federal government authority to negotiate lower prices with drug companies.;Jim Clyburn;health

Irregular contact with doctors means many men fail to receive any preventive care for potentially life-threatening conditions. In addition, when men do seek care, embarrassment can often prevent them from openly discussing health concerns with their physicians.;Michael Crapo;health

Col. Shaffer is prohibited by his lawyer from talking. He's at great risk. They want to take away his pay and his health care benefits so they can hold it over his head and not allow him to talk while he's under suspension. This is not America.;Curt Weldon;health
Today, diabetes is now epidemic, according to the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health, the American Diabetes Association and other national healthcare leaders.;Tim Holden;health
I am not the Conservative Party's health care spokesman. I'm fond of Andrew Lansley, and I strongly support David Cameron as party leader.;Daniel Hannan;health
In speech after speech on his health care plan, the President has tried to convince us that what he is proposing will be good for America. But, how can it be good for America if it raises taxes by a half trillion dollars and costs a trillion dollars or more to implement?;Scott Brown;health

Congress is attempting to eviscerate women's health care. Like many women across America, I am outraged.;Felicity Huffman;health
The truth is women use contraception not only as a way to prevent unintended pregnancies, but also to improve their health and the health of their families. Increased access to contraception is directly linked to declines in maternal and infant mortality.;Felicity Huffman;health

I would put our legislative and foreign policy accomplishments in our first two years against any president - with the possible exceptions of Johnson, FDR, and Lincoln - just in terms of what we've gotten done in modern history.

If you look at U.S. history through religious history, there is very much a motif that shows the importance religion has played in the U.S. We're a very religious country and it affects the way we look at various political issues.;Madeleine Albright;history
My major allegiance has been to storytelling, not to history.;Russell Banks;history
The history of man is the history of crimes, and history can repeat. So information is a defence. Through this we can build, we must build, a defence against repetition.;Simon Wiesenthal;history
The oppressed peoples can liberate themselves only through struggle. This is a simple and clear truth confirmed by history.;Kim Il-sung;history

It is the great sadness of our species that we have not found a way to eliminate the conflict and to eliminate violence as a device to resolve our conflicts throughout the entire history of the human race.;Neale Donald Walsch;history

There are times in history where a particular doctrine becomes a symbol of a greater problem.;Pat Robertson;history
Is there in all the history of human folly a greater fool than a clergymen in politics?;Pat Robertson;history

To study history means submitting to chaos and nevertheless retaining faith in order and meaning.;Hermann Hesse;history
But when one believes that you've been appointed by God for a particular mission in history, you have to be very careful about that, how you speak about that. Where is the self-reflection in that? Where is the humility in that?;Jim Wallis;history
I believe that history has shape, order, and meaning that exceptional men, as much as economic forces, produce change and that passe abstractions like beauty, nobility, and greatness have a shifting but continuing validity.;Camille Paglia;history
All objects, all phases of culture are alive. They have voices. They speak of their history and interrelatedness. And they are all talking at once!;Camille Paglia;history
American policy seems to be wed to a perpetual state of war. Why? History shows that the world will always be in flux or turmoil, with different peoples competing for visibility and power. The U.S. cannot fix the fate of every nation.;Camille Paglia;history
My generation of bossy, confident, baby-boom women were something brand new in history. Our energy and assertiveness weren't created by Betty Friedan, unknown before her 1963 book, or by Gloria Steinem, whose political activism, as even the Lifetime profile admitted, did not begin until 1969.;Camille Paglia;history
Our liberal, New York/Washington-based media would never in a million years put Liberal Godfather Ted Kennedy on the spot about his clan's bad behavior, to whose lurid history he himself has contributed so much.;Camille Paglia;history

Among famous traitors of history one might mention the weather.;Ilka Chase;history
Literature is the expression of a feeling of deprivation, a recourse against a sense of something missing. But the contrary is also true: language is what makes us human. It is a recourse against the meaningless noise and silence of nature and history.;Octavio Paz;history
My argument is that War makes rattling good history but Peace is poor reading.;Thomas Hardy;history
I thought that all of the sacrifices and blessings of the whole history of mankind have devolved upon me. Thank you, God.;Ben Stein;history

I was reading a book... 'the history of glue' - I couldn't put it down.;Tim Vine;history

But every historical statement and legitimization itself moves within a certain relation to history.;Martin Heidegger;history
Dorothy is the only woman in history who has had her menopause in public and made it pay.;Alice Roosevelt Longworth;history

The nation is faced with one of the most corporate-orientated anti-consumer Congresses in our history.;Ralph Nader;history
We can't understand when we're pregnant, or when our siblings are expecting, how profound it is to have a shared history with a younger generation: blood, genes, humor. It means we were actually here, on Earth, for a time - like the Egyptians with their pyramids, only with children.;Anne Lamott;history
My father and I made genetics history. We were the first African-Americans and the first father and son anywhere to have their genomes sequenced.;Henry Louis Gates;history
So many people of color who made major contributions to American history have been trapped in the purgatory of history.;Henry Louis Gates;history
America is the greatest nation ever founded. The ideals are the greatest ever espoused in human history, and we just need the country to live up to them. But what I worry about are the 1 million black men in the prison system.;Henry Louis Gates;history
What people forget is that the most radical thing about Obama is that he was the first black man in history to imagine that he could become president, who was able to make other Americans believe it as well. Other than that, he is a centrist, just like I try to be. He's been bridging divisions his whole life.;Henry Louis Gates;history
Wherever you go in the history of America, there have been Black people making contributions, but their contributions have been obscured, lost, buried.;Henry Louis Gates;history

In history as in human life, regret does not bring back a lost moment and a thousand years will not recover something lost in a single hour.;Stefan Zweig;history
When you say things like, 'We have to wipe out the Taliban,' what does that mean? The Taliban is not a fixed number of people. The Taliban is an ideology that has sprung out of a history that, you know, America created anyway.;Arundhati Roy;history
Those who invoke history will certainly be heard by history. And they will have to accept its verdict.;Dag Hammarskjold;history
Destiny is something not be to desired and not to be avoided. a mystery not contrary to reason, for it implies that the world, and the course of human history, have meaning.;Dag Hammarskjold;history

The possibility of a scientific treatment of history means a wider experience, a greater maturity of practical reason, and finally a fuller realization of certain basic ideas regarding the nature of life and time.;Muhammad Iqbal;history

History shows that when the church accommodates culture, it weakens it.;Rick Warren;history
There is a spirit and a need and a man at the beginning of every great human advance. Every one of these must be right for that particular moment of history, or nothing happens.;Coretta Scott King;history
Hollywood has a history of raising expectations beyond Washington's reach, of appealing to the very American desire to mythologize political leaders, particularly the president.;Ron Fournier;history
In the tumult of men and events, solitude was my temptation now it is my friend. What other satisfaction can be sought once you have confronted History?;Charles de Gaulle;history

I am fascinated by history and particularly the Victorian era.;Annie Lennox;history
Love is more pleasant than marriage for the same reason that novels are more amusing than history.;Nicolas Chamfort;history
I love places that have an incredible history. I love the Italian way of life. I love the food. I love the people. I love the attitudes of Italians.;Elton John;history
After the Berlin Wall came down I visited that city and I will never forget it. The abandoned checkpoints. The sense of excitement about the future. The knowledge that a great continent was coming together. Healing those wounds of our history is the central story of the European Union.;David Cameron;history
From Caesar's legions to the Napoleonic wars. From the Reformation, the Enlightenment and the industrial revolution to the defeat of nazism. We have helped to write European history, and Europe has helped write ours.;David Cameron;history
The biggest danger to the European Union comes not from those who advocate change, but from those who denounce new thinking as heresy. In its long history Europe has experience of heretics who turned out to have a point.;David Cameron;history

Robots have a rich and storied history in movies.;John Podhoretz;history
Nixon in 1968, unlike Obama 2008, was elected as a minority president with only 43 percent of the vote. Yet, in 1972, he won what, in some measures, was the most lopsided election in American history with 61 percent.;John Podhoretz;history
Obama has seen to the passage of the most radical legislation in recent American history and so-called 'progressives' should be thanking him for it - even as many of the rest of us rear in horror from its implications.;John Podhoretz;history

There are certain moments in the history of a nation when the choices made define the decades to come.;Georgios A. Papandreou;history

I do consider myself part of black history.;Mary J. Blige;history
The United States is the only power in history that became great by giving and not by taking. I think the crisis was when the United States had more money than ideas. Money doesn't produce money. Ideas produce money.;Shimon Peres;history

Man's naked form belongs to no particular moment in history it is eternal, and can be looked upon with joy by the people of all ages.;Auguste Rodin;history

World history is a court of judgment.;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel;history
Very few conflicts in the history of the world have been satisfactorily concluded according to a published timetable, because you lose all flexibility in dealing with your opponents.;William Hague;history

History is the science of things which are not repeated.;Paul Valery;history
The history of thought may be summed up in these words: it is absurd by what it seeks and great by what it finds.;Paul Valery;history
Nigeria has had a complicated colonial history. My work has examined that part of our story extensively.;Chinua Achebe;history

Sometimes history takes things into its own hands.;Thurgood Marshall;history
We have our own history, our own language, our own culture. But our destiny is also tied up with the destinies of other people - history has made us all South Africans.;Mangosuthu Buthelezi;history
I know the history of the record business so well because I followed Billie Holiday into the record studios. It was so primitive compared to the sophisticated business today.;Tony Bennett;history
Yes, they broke the law, but we can't deport them. Let's get over this pointing fingers and do something about that, whether it - they have to pay a fine, learn to speak English, the history, you can do that. And then you have to give visas for the skills we need.;Michael Bloomberg;history
I'm really interested in modern history, but to fulfill a History degree at Brown you have to do modern and pre-modern.;Emma Watson;history

The long-established and noble rule of Law, one of the greatest products of the character and tradition of British history, has suffered a deadly blow. Blackmail has become respectable.;Robert Menzies;history
You're going to relegate my history to a month.;Morgan Freeman;history
But look, I was born in 1956, the peak year for births in US history.

I think feminists are unaware of the tremendous extent of the role of women in history.;Vivienne Westwood;history
I don't have space to enter into the examples or the history of this, so I'm left with having to make the bold statement that culture is extinct.;Vivienne Westwood;history
In history people dressed much better than we do today.;Vivienne Westwood;history
It's in the history books, the Holocaust. It's just a phrase. And the truth is it happened yesterday. It happened to my mother. I never met my grandmothers or my grandfathers. They were all wiped up in the gas chambers of Nazi Germany.;Gene Simmons;history
My face has changed with the years and has enough history in it to give audiences something to work with.;Jeanne Moreau;history
If history is a guide, a victory for Obama means he faces the prospect of a second term dogged by scandal or inertia.;Ron Fournier;history
Part of the problem is voters know relatively little about Romney. And some of what they know about him complicates his task: Romney has a history of flip-flopping on issues, he's extraordinarily wealthy, and he can be tone-deaf about what moves voters. He just doesn't seem comfortable in his skin.;Ron Fournier;history
I normally ignore the History Channel.;Diablo Cody;history
Life moves fast. As much as you can learn from your history, you have to move forward.;Eddie Vedder;history
History and experience tell us that moral progress comes not in comfortable and complacent times, but out of trial and confusion.;Gerald R. Ford;history
The institution of chivalry forms one of the most remarkable features in the history of the Middle Ages.;Horatio Alger;history

It is sometimes very hard to tell the difference between history and the smell of skunk.;Rebecca West;history
When you think of how history is revealed, we know certain things to be facts at certain periods of time, which turn out not to be so factual as time marches on.;John Malkovich;history
Texas was such a welcoming place, and with its unbelievable history and tradition, it's extra special to be a part of that.;Ricky Williams;history
Over the objections, where they sound like squealing pigs, over the objections of Romney and all his allies, we passed some of the toughest Wall Street regulations in history, turning Wall Street back into the allocator of capital it always has been and no longer a casino. And they want to repeal it.;Joe Biden;history
There's a lot of revisionist history that goes on these days about Iraq.;Joe Biden;history
I graduated from the University of Delaware with a double major in history and political science.;Joe Biden;history
The truth is, of course, that history is not completed in modern commerce any more than philosophy is perfected in political economy. In other words, there is nothing timeless or God-given about filling stations and penicillin and plastic bags.;James Buchan;history
I'm inspired by history, different periods.;Adam Lambert;history
I like animals. I like natural history. The travel bit is not the important bit. The travel bit is what you have to do in order to go and look at animals.;David Attenborough;history
In the old days... it was a basic, cardinal fact that producers didn't have opinions. When I was producing natural history programmes, I didn't use them as vehicles for my own opinion. They were factual programmes.;David Attenborough;history
You can only get really unpopular decisions through if the electorate is convinced of the value of the environment. That's what natural history programmes should be for.;David Attenborough;history
Cameramen are among the most extraordinarily able and competent people I know. They have to have an insight into natural history that gives them a sixth sense of what the creature is going to do, so they can be ready to follow.;David Attenborough;history
The process of making natural history films is to try to prevent the animal knowing you are there, so you get glimpses of a non-human world, and that is a transporting thing.;David Attenborough;history
Natural history is not about producing fables.;David Attenborough;history
If I were beginning my career today, I don't think I would take the same direction. Television is at a crossroads at the moment. And although I am not up to date technologically, I suspect that somewhere out there people are conveying things about natural history by means other than television, and I think if I were beginning today, I'd be there.;David Attenborough;history
He who puts out his hand to stop the wheel of history will have his fingers crushed.;Lech Walesa;history

Horror is the natural reaction to the last 5,000 years of history.;Robert Anton Wilson;history
If you take a look at history, you will find that the understanding of what is good and evil has always existed before the individual religions. The religions were only invented by people afterwards, in order to express this idea.;Salman Rushdie;history
Uncertainty and fear and ignorance about immigrants, about people who are different, has a history as old as our Nation.;Luis Gutierrez;history
You don't hate history, you hate the way it was taught to you in high school.;Stephen Ambrose;history

I don't think that there's been one example in history where somebody has openly talked about their personal life and it's done them any good.;Rashida Jones;history
Governments that use violence to stop democratic development will not earn themselves respite forever. They will pay an increasingly high price for actions which they can no longer hide from the world with ease, and will find themselves on the wrong side of history.;William Hague;history
Well, the first thing is that truth and power for me form an antithesis, an antagonism, which will hardly ever be resolved. I can define in fact, can simplify the history of human society, the evolution of human society, as a contest between power and freedom.;Wole Soyinka;history
For all of higher civilization's recorded history, becoming a man was defined overwhelmingly as taking responsibility for a family.;Dennis Prager;history
I was determined to achieve the total freedom that our history lessons taught us we were entitled to, no matter what the sacrifice.;Rosabeth Moss Kanter;history
After Nixon resigned in 1974, he engaged in a very aggressive war with history, attempting to wipe out the Watergate stain and memory. Happily, history won, largely because of Nixon's tapes.;Bob Woodward;history
Let me tell you, never before in the history of this planet has anybody made the progress that African-Americans have made in a 30-year period, in spite of many black folks and white folks lying to one another.;Dick Gregory;history
Hip-hop's always reached out to kids. If you look at the last 10 big albums it might seem ironic. But when I look at the history of this music it's always had a lot of positivity.;LL Cool J;history
Western history has been a history of deed done, actions performed and results achieved.;Arthur Erickson;history
What is the thread of western civilization that distinguished its course in history? It has to do with the preoccupation of western man with his outward command and his sense of superiority.;Arthur Erickson;history
I'm trying to make a case for those people who don't have a sense of belonging that they should have, that there is something really worthwhile in having a sense of belonging, and recasting and looking at our modern history.;Billy Bragg;history
For at the same time many people seem eager to extend the circle of our moral consideration to animals, in our factory farms and laboratories we are inflicting more suffering on more animals than at any time in history.;Michael Pollan;history
I think it was my study of history that convinced me that the Democratic Party was more on the side of the average American.;George McGovern;history
The upward course of a nation's history is due in the long run to the soundness of heart of its average men and women.;Queen Elizabeth II;history
There's always a part of your nation's history that you haven't been told that... has a powerful impact on how you yourself may behave and may believe.;Barbara Kingsolver;history
The middle class, one of the great achievements in history, is becoming more of a relic than a reality.;Jon Meacham;history
Part of what I loved - and love - about being around older people is the tangible sense of history they embody. I'm interested in military history, for instance, because both my grandfathers fought in World War II. I'm interested in writing because one of those grandfathers wrote books.;Jon Meacham;history
From Jefferson to Jackson to Lincoln to FDR to Reagan, every great president inspires enormous affection and enormous hostility. We'll all be much saner, I think, if we remember that history is full of surprises and things that seemed absolutely certain one day are often unimaginable the next.;Jon Meacham;history
Given that religious faith is an intrinsic element of human experience, it is best to approach and engage the subject with a sense of history and a critical sensibility.;Jon Meacham;history
World War II ended the Great Depression with one of the great public-private industrial collaborations in the history of man.;Jon Meacham;history
The fact is that America has been at her most prosperous when government and the private sector have been not at war, but in a wary, if often underplayed, alliance. History is unmistakable on this point.;Jon Meacham;history
With the perspective afforded by the passage of time, where does 9/11 rank as a turning point in our national history? For the victims and their families, innocents going about their lives, suddenly and brutally murdered, no other day can ever matter as much.;Jon Meacham;history
I believe history will come to view 9/11 as an event on par with November 22, 1963, the date on which John F. Kennedy was murdered, cutting short a presidency that was growing ever more promising. Dreams died that day in Dallas it is easy to imagine the 1960s turning out rather differently had President Kennedy lived.;Jon Meacham;history
Religious belief, like history itself, is a story that is always unfolding, always subject to inquiry and ripe for questioning. For without doubt there is no faith.;Jon Meacham;history
History tells us that America does best when the private sector is energetic and entrepreneurial and the government is attentive and engaged. Who among us, really, would, looking back, wish to edit out either sphere at the entire expense of the other?;Jon Meacham;history
The past always seems somehow more golden, more serious, than the present. We tend to forget the partisanship of yesteryear, preferring to re-imagine our history as a sure and steady march toward greatness.;Jon Meacham;history
In retrospect, the Millennium marked only a moment in time. It was the events of September 11 that marked a turning point in history, where we confront the dangers of the future and assess the choices facing humankind.;Tony Blair;history
The best history is but like the art of Rembrandt it casts a vivid light on certain selected causes, on those which were best and greatest it leaves all the rest in shadow and unseen.;Walter Bagehot;history
It's not the sentiments of men which make history but their actions.;Norman Mailer;history
We need a better way to talk about eating animals, a way that doesn't ignore or even just shruggingly accept things like habits, cravings, family and history but rather incorporates them into the conversation. The more they are allowed in, the more able we will be to follow our best instincts.;Jonathan Safran Foer;history
Jews have a special relationship to books, and the Haggadah has been translated more widely, and reprinted more often, than any other Jewish book. It is not a work of history or philosophy, not a prayer book, user's manual, timeline, poem or palimpsest - and yet it is all these things.;Jonathan Safran Foer;history
There is at least one point in the history of any company when you have to change dramatically to rise to the next level of performance. Miss that moment - and you start to decline.;Andy Grove;history
We also have to make sure our children know the history of women. Tell them the rotten truth: It wasn't always possible for women to become doctors or managers or insurance people. Let them be armed with a true picture of the way we want it to be.;Anne Roiphe;history
I just think it would be unrealistic to suggest we're going to eliminate every last domestic insurgent in Afghanistan. Certainly, the history of the country would indicate that's not a very realistic objective, and I think we have to have realistic objectives.;Stephen Harper;history
Violence is a part of America. I don't want to single out rap music. Let's be honest. America's the most violent country in the history of the world, that's just the way it is. We're all affected by it.;Spike Lee;history
As a state we are so uniquely positioned in so many ways. Our geography, our placement in the country, and our history positions us to be the state that propels energy efficiency as an industry.;Jennifer Granholm;history
The library is the temple of learning, and learning has liberated more people than all the wars in history.;Carl T. Rowan;history
If America wants to retain its position as a global power, its president must listen to the people and show strong leadership at this turning point in human history.;David Suzuki;history
The subject matter is very tricky. It's about the Munich massacre and what Mossad did afterwards with the assassination squads. I think it's a turning point in history, especially for the Palestinians.;Daniel Craig;history
It's a huge challenge, a huge responsibility. Bond is a huge iconic figure in movie history. These opportunities don't come along very often so I thought, 'Why not?';Daniel Craig;history
But let me tell you, this gender thing is history. You're looking at a guy who sat down with Margaret Thatcher across the table and talked about serious issues.;George H. W. Bush;history
History will point out some of the things I did wrong and some of the things I did right.;George H. W. Bush;history
I have written too much history to have faith in it and if anyone thinks I'm wrong, I am inclined to agree with him.;Henry Adams;history
Permanent superiority has never been realized by any nation in history. After the rise comes the fall.;Paul Harris;history
OUR history begins before we are born. We represent the hereditary influences of our race, and our ancestors virtually live in us.;James Nasmyth;history
I did not come to NASA to make history.;Sally Ride;history
The history of Christianity, therefore, must be of concern to all who are interested in the record of man and particularly to all who seek to understand the contemporary human scene.;Kenneth Scott Latourette;history
The year 2008 was a reminder to those who had forgotten that there is such a thing as history and that the cycle of famine and feast in commerce, first identified in antiquity and well understood in the Middle Ages, was not suddenly abolished in modern times.;James Buchan;history
If good history is dispassionate history, it must naturally wait until the passions of the period subside.;James Buchan;history
One of the consequences of the Iranian revolution has been an explosion of history. A country once known only from British consular reports and intrepid travelogues is now awash with historical documents, letters, diaries, grainy video, weblogs and secret police files of questionable authenticity.;James Buchan;history
Bulls don't read. Bears read financial history. As markets fall to bits, the bears dust off the Dutch tulip mania of 1637, the Banque Royale of 1719-20, the railway speculation of the 1840s, the great crash of 1929.;James Buchan;history
Cause and effect, the riddle of all history, is a particular devil in financial history and never more so than today, where entire classes of security are collapsing not on public exchanges and stock-tickers but because there are no markets to establish prices this side of nothing.;James Buchan;history
Nowhere else in history has there ever been a flag that stands for the right to burn itself. This is the fractal of our flag. It stands for the right to destroy itself.;Ken Kesey;history
Humanity has experienced many revolutionary changes over the course of history: revolutions in agriculture, in science, industrial production, as well as numerous political revolutions. But these have all been limited to the external aspects of our individual and collective lives.;Daisaku Ikeda;history

I don't see women and think of them as competition or with judgment. Women really move me. I feel connected to all kinds of women. I am angry because I think we've been mistreated throughout history in different countries, including America. I admire women.;Salma Hayek;history

But I think it's more that when you're young, you're invincible, you're immortal - or at least you think you are. The possibilities are limitless, you're inventing the future.

What creates freedom? A revolution in the streets? Mass protest? Civil war? A change of government? The ousting of the old guard and its replacement by the new? History, more often than not, shows that hopes raised by such events are often dashed, sooner rather than later.;Jonathan Sacks;history

For most of our history, no one dared to tell Americans, 'you don't build that.';Rand Paul;history
I had a go at changing history - maybe not all by myself - I fought at the battle of Normandy, I slogged through the Ardennes, and I celebrated the liberation of Paris on the streets with beautiful French girls throwing flowers at me. I said good-bye to my first true love and discovered what I really wanted to do with my life.;LeRoy Neiman;history
Every writer has his writing technique - what he can and can't do to describe something like war or history. I'm not good at writing about those things, but I try because I feel it is necessary to write that kind of thing.;Haruki Murakami;history
The current state of knowledge is a moment in history, changing just as rapidly as the state of knowledge in the past has ever changed and, in many instances, more rapidly.;Jean Piaget;history
I'm a good son, a good father, a good husband - I've been married to the same woman for 30 years. I'm a good friend. I finished college, I have my education, I donate money anonymously. So when people criticize the kind of characters that I play on screen, I go, 'You know, that's part of history.';Samuel L. Jackson;history
This is what I wanted. They tell me that London is the best field in history. I wanted to be part of that. Because everyone will be there it will be a wonderful challenge for me.

I want to go down in history.;Haile Gebrselassie;history

I like American history.;Kevin Costner;history

If history could teach us anything, it would be that private property is inextricably linked with civilization.;Ludwig von Mises;history

I realise that I do not change the course of history. I am an actor, I do a movie, that's the end of it. You have to realise we are just clowns for hire. After I had success it was great, at first, not to worry about money. It was on my mind when I was growing up.;Leonardo DiCaprio;history

In my world, history comes down to language and art. No one cares much about what battles were fought, who won them and who lost them - unless there is a painting, a play, a song or a poem that speaks of the event.;Theodore Bikel;history
In human history, the desire for revenge and the desire for loot have often been closely associated.;John McCarthy;history

Between France and Senegal there's a history. There's a language that we both speak. There's a culture that we share and to which both of our peoples have contributed.

The '80s were fabulous. The '90s sucked, and the '70s were just a sad, sad time in human history. Go 1980s! There's something that's just so cute about that time. And not just yellow nail polish and 'I'm a loner.';Jennifer Sky;history

History is full of people who went to prison or were burned at the stake for proclaiming their ideas. Society has always defended itself.;Naguib Mahfouz;history
It is in Rousseau's writing above all that history begins to turn from upper-class honour to middle-class humanitarianism. Pity, sympathy and compassion lie at the centre of his moral vision. Values associated with the feminine begin to infiltrate social existence as a whole, rather than being confined to the domestic sphere.;Terry Eagleton;history
Introspection and preserved writings give us far more insight into the ways of past humans than we have into the ways of past dinosaurs. For that reason, I'm optimistic that we can eventually arrive at convincing explanations for these broadest patterns of human history.;Jared Diamond;history

In almost every interview someone asks what does HIM stand for. I can't even remember our latest lie about that. When Hanson was hot, we said it means Hanson Is Murder. The name doesn't have a particular history. His Infernal Majesty was a totally different band. I think HIM derives from some death metal joke.;Ville Valo;history

I don't have a long family history of good cooks in my family.;Bobby Flay;history
My mother, whom I love dearly, has continually revised my life story within the context of a complicated family history that includes more than the usual share of divorce, step-children, dysfunction, and obfuscation. I've spent most of my adult life attempting to deconstruct that history and separate fact from fiction.;Melissa Gilbert;history

The whole history of civilization is strewn with creeds and institutions which were invaluable at first, and deadly afterwards.;Walter Bagehot;history
More people have more access to more readers for less money than ever before in history.

'Days' has always been strong as an icon in TV history, and it's still going on strong and represents the genre of daytime drama so well. I'm proud to be a part of it.;Alison Sweeney;history
As a freelance writer, I'd be asked to become an expert for various magazines on any subject, whether food or wine or history or the life span of veterinarians. I was completely unschooled in any of these things.;John Hodgman;history

Crimes of which a people is ashamed constitute its real history. The same is true of man.;Jean Genet;history
Revolutions are the periods of history when individuals count most.;Norman Mailer;history
Accuracy is paramount in every detail of a work of history. Here's my rule: Ask yourself, 'Did this thing happen?' If the answer is yes, then it's historical.

The general consensus among historians, among the ones who can handle the fact that 'Lincoln' is, in fact, historical fiction, is that we demonstrate enormous fidelity to history and that, beyond that, we've actually contributed a line of thinking about Lincoln's presidency that's somewhat original.;Tony Kushner;history
A handful of works in history have had a direct impact on social policy: one or two works of Dickens, some of Zola, 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' and, in modern drama, Larry Kramer's 'The Normal Heart.';Tony Kushner;history

Sending Paris Hilton to jail for being the most loathed celeprosy lesion in the history of the species seems like a happening idea at first - forty-five days at Century Regional Detention Center is so the new thirty days at Promises Malibu!

It's a feeling few people experience, and that's usually when I come up with weird stuff. It just flows. I can't force myself. I don't sit down and say I've got to practice.;Eddie Van Halen;home
The juvenile sea squirt wanders through the sea searching for a suitable rock or hunk of coral to cling to and make its home for life. For this task, it has a rudimentary nervous system. When it finds its spot and takes root, it doesn't need its brain anymore so it eats it!;Daniel Dennett;home

I hit the ground running, without a lot of training, so I had to do whatever I could do to survive as a professional, and if that meant being that character 24/7 and acting out, I was going to do that. I lived those characters, I brought them home with me.;Nicolas Cage;home
I bought a Yamaha-1 and I was doing 180 miles per hour home on the 405 and that's really, really crazy but I did it.;Nicolas Cage;home
The thing I like about baseball is that it's one-on-one. You stand up there alone, and if you make a mistake, it's your mistake. If you hit a home run, it's your home run.;Hank Aaron;home
Just as the police review their operational tactics, so we in the Home Office will review the powers available to the police.;Theresa May;home

I'm kind of a dork. I don't have much game. I'm not particularly comfortable in bars or clubs. I much prefer being home playing Scrabble, having dinner with a couple friends, going to see a movie, or losing a whole weekend to Season 14 of Law and Order or The Simpsons.;Wentworth Miller;home
Entertainers are there to entertain. They aren't there to teach your children the lessons that you haven't bothered to teach them at home yourself.;Wentworth Miller;home
I like spending time at home. In Paris, people drop by and have a bite to eat, or they drop by and watch Friends on TV. I take my dog to the office there, and I walk to work sometimes.;Marc Jacobs;home

Especially when you play at home, you need a good atmosphere behind you.;Jose Mourinho;home

We want you to sit down and leave your egos at home and let's get an understanding as to where all this is foolishness coming from. There are others who are putting things out there or throwing a stick and hiding their hand and keeping things built up in the media.;Afrika Bambaataa;home
The best thing that ever happened to me is that nothing happened in writing. I ended up working for engineering companies, and that's where I found my material, in the everyday struggle between capitalism and grace. Being broke and tired, you don't come home your best self.;George Saunders;home

When I was doing 'Scarface,' I remember being in love at that time. One of the few times in my life. And I was so glad it was at that time.

My family went through divorces and remarriages and the later, blended home - and then watched that home explode, too.;Jeffrey Kluger;home
Spare a thought for the poor introverts among us. In a world of party animals and glad-handers, they're the ones who stand by the punch bowl. In a world of mixers and pub crawls, they prefer to stay home with a book. Everywhere around them, cell phones ring and e-mails chime and they just want a little quiet.;Jeffrey Kluger;home
There's only one thing harder than living in a home with an adolescent - and that's being an adolescent. The moodiness, the volatility, the wholesale lack of impulse control, all would be close to clinical conditions if they occurred at another point in life. In adolescence, they're just part of the behavioral portfolio.;Jeffrey Kluger;home
Coming home to my family afterward makes the work richer, easier and more fun.;Edie Falco;home

You want to come home to a nice firm bed with the corners tucked in so you start over, like each night is like a new night.;Gabrielle Union;home

Even cooking at home, the difference between my wife cooking and me cooking is major. When my wife cooks, the kitchen looks like a disaster. When I cook it's completely clean and organized and it doesn't look like anyone has been cooking in there.;Tom Colicchio;home

Most cooks try to learn by making dishes. Doesn't mean you can cook. It means you can make that dish. When you can cook is when you can go to a farmers market, buy a bunch of stuff, then go home and make something without looking at a recipe. Now you're cooking.;Tom Colicchio;home
When I get old, I'm going to the old folks' home. I don't want to be one of those guys who's hanging around the house bothering the kids. But not just any old folks' home. I want the whole top floor.;Shaquille O'Neal;home
We're adults. We're the ones who should teach the kids what's good to eat. I don't think the government should ever regulate what we eat at home, but we're feeding them in school with tax dollars. Quite frankly, if my tax dollars are being spent to feed kids, I'd rather feed them better food.;Tom Colicchio;home
I'm a married man. If I want sex at this particular point in my life, I go home for it.;Davy Jones;home

I'm like a really goofy home ec teacher.;Alton Brown;home
I know people that could serve me canned tuna and saltine crackers and have me feel more at home at their table than some people who can cook circles around me. The more you try to impress people, generally the less you do.;Alton Brown;home

I remind everyone: Whether you school them at home or send them to school, you as a parent have the responsibility to make sure they learn and behave. Teachers and principals may help, but parents are the ones who must accept responsibility.;Ernest Istook;home

The hardest thing is spending twelve hours a day accommodating the rest of the world, then going home at night and criticizing it. I would be curious about what I'd write if I didn't have to worry about offending.;Sloane Crosley;home
Like most citizens of popular and international urban centres, I don't take advantage of the cultural opportunities. Perhaps this comes from growing up in suburbia. Home is where you eat, sleep, read, watch television and ignore your parents. It is not where you go to the ballet and then attend a heated panel discussion about it afterwards.;Sloane Crosley;home
If I go into a sandwich shop or anywhere that features 'Today's specials' on a chalkboard more than 10 feet away, I have to ask for a printed menu. I smile at people I don't know on the street and ignore those I do. When at home, I often find myself grabbing my 'back-up' glasses to search for the better-loved pair I have left on top of my dresser.;Sloane Crosley;home
However, I was a restaurant critic at Chicago magazine before I worked at Esquire, and I've been a really enthusiastic home cook for a long time. It's just something I'm passionate about.;Ted Allen;home
When I come home from a shoot, I'd rather reheat food I've made than eat takeout.;Ted Allen;home
I chose America as my home because I value freedom and democracy, civil liberties and an open society.;George Soros;home
While I enjoy spending time in L.A., Britain is my home.;Michael Sheen;home
I think I'm becoming more relaxed in front of a camera. I suppose I'll always feel slightly more at home on stage. It's more of an actor's medium. You are your own editor, nobody else is choosing what is being seen of you.;Michael Sheen;home
I've now been in this country for thirteen years, since I was seventeen. So this is my second home.;Hakeem Olajuwon;home

I love coming back to Neath - this is home and always will be.;Katherine Jenkins;home
Oh, stuff the critics. I don't care. Too many people are snooty about classical. Look, I wasn't brought up in a home where we listened to classical music. It was a singing teacher that thought it would be best for my voice. Then I moved into crossover. And if that makes the music accessible to more people, then great.;Katherine Jenkins;home
I'm launching my own festival in South Wales. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time. It's going to be held at Margam Park, because I wanted the venue to be as close to my home as possible.;Katherine Jenkins;home
I wish I got a little bit more time at home. I am away a lot and being around my loved ones and friends is good for me. It grounds me. It's something I need to make more time for. I think I need a little more balance.;Katherine Jenkins;home
I go home and don't get treated any differently. People have known me all my life and are interested and very supportive but because they have known me forever I don't get any diva treatment. My mum still tells me off if I haven't loaded the dishwasher for her.;Katherine Jenkins;home
With all the hundreds of dresses and shoes I have, it would be an absolute crime if I don't have a little girl. I have a whole room at home filled with my stage wear.;Katherine Jenkins;home

I don't like travelling. Which is ridiculous. And it's not because I'm afraid of dying on the plane or anything. I just like to stay at home.;Rachel Weisz;home
The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb. So the light bulb is what wired the world. And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world. They were really thinking about - they weren't putting electricity into the home. They were putting lighting into the home.;Jeff Bezos;home
The one thing that offends me the most is when I walk by a bank and see ads trying to convince people to take out second mortgages on their home so they can go on vacation. That's approaching evil.;Jeff Bezos;home
The relevance for 9/11 is that what 9/11 marked was the beginning of a struggle in which the terrorists come at us and strike us here on our home territory. And it's a global operation. It doesn't know national boundaries or national borders.;Dick Cheney;home
An education program is, by definition, a societal program. Work should be done at school, rather than at home.;Francois Hollande;home

Events at home, at work, in the street - these are the bases for a story.;Naguib Mahfouz;home

I'm just like so many women - I was frustrated, I had these white pants that I had spent a lot of money on, and you get home and you think, 'What am I really supposed to wear under this?' So it was a frustrated consumer moment.;Sara Blakely;home
I believe that parents need to make nutrition education a priority in their home environment. It's crucial for good health and longevity to instill in your children sound eating habits from an early age.;Cat Cora;home
The thing about being at home versus being out in the world working is, it's a whole different vibe. When I'm home with my kids and partner, I will cook - even though she's a very good cook. She's learned over the years. We started with basics, you know, how to saute onions, how to saute mushrooms.;Cat Cora;home
If eating out, order your meal and ask the server to wrap up half of the portion to take home with your for the next day, keeping your portion size in check, and stretching your dollar into two meals.;Cat Cora;home
I've been experimenting more and more with LN2, liquid nitrogen. I've used it in battle on 'Iron Chef America,' but have also made some great ice creams at home for my family. Since it freezes basically on contact, you can have ice cream ready in mere minutes.;Cat Cora;home
When I'm home, the heart and soul of our family is in the kitchen. Growing up, my parents both worked, so dinnertime was for family - the TV was off. I think it's important to grab that time and really make it special, even after a tough day.;Cat Cora;home
From the moment this baby came into our home, those two dogs have never been more in love. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever witnessed. People keep saying, 'Oh, you're a single mom.' I'm like, 'Actually, I'm not. I've got two boys helping.';Charlize Theron;home

My grandmother always taught me, 'If you don't have a home, family, and church, you don't have anything.';Jennifer Hudson;home
When I go on the plane to fly home, I'm literally capable of forgetting what I do for a job. That also comes about because I choose to take massive breaks between projects, and because I choose to do this ridiculous thing of keeping home, home.;Eric Bana;home

But you know, there's something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day, working one-on-one, getting all this attention - they go home, they're finished. They don't stall, they don't do their homework in front of the TV.;Dave Eggers;home
I met a lot of great people in Saudi Arabia and I'd like to see them again. And I'd love to spend more time in the desert and in the mountains. I felt really at home there.;Dave Eggers;home

Everywhere you hang your hat is home. Home is the bright cave under the hat.;Lance Morrow;home
When I am made fun of in the press I just remember those days when I'd come home to find that the water had been turned off because my mother couldn't afford the bill. Suddenly, everything feels easier.;Beth Ditto;home
Having robbed children of any sense that their Father is in Heaven and that they are His creation, we then launched an experiment in raising them without earthly fathers too. Having neither a Father in heaven or a father in the home, many young men make gangs their families.;Gary Bauer;home
Do I ever think Gossip will be really massive in America? No, I don't think it'll happen - and that's fine. It's kind of nice because I get to experience everything at once. I get to come home and it not be weird, like in Paris or something. It is nice to be completely anonymous.;Beth Ditto;home
As the prospect of a Tory government gets nearer, many traditional Labour voters - some who switched away in recent times and many who stayed at home - seem more determined to prevent that happening.;Lucy Powell;home

When I was younger, my coach, Liang Chow, made all the decisions. I would go to the gym for practice, do exactly what Chow told me to do, go home, come back and start all over again. If Chow told me to do 50 squat jumps, I did 50 squat jumps.;Shawn Johnson;home
I keep my own personality in a cupboard under the stairs at home so that no one else can see it or nick it.;Dawn French;home
New England is the home of all that is good and noble with all her sternness and uncompromising opinions.;Ellen Henrietta Swallow Richards;home
The aesthetic came along the way, I think - just through experimenting, and going on tour, and trying stuff out on stage, having fun with it, and not taking it too seriously. If I had a ballgown at home, I'd wear it onstage. If I found something in a charity shop, I'd wear it. That's where it grew from - just wanting to play dress-up.;Florence Welch;home
Mr. Bean is at his best when he is not using words, but I am equally at home in both verbal and nonverbal expression.;Rowan Atkinson;home
Confronting a stadium audience, you can't see the whites of their eyes. It's just an amorphous mass of noise and, of course, you can't see the alleged billions watching at home either, so the degree to which you are intimidated is quite low.;Rowan Atkinson;home
Obviously, the easiest recipes are the most successful when it comes to the home cook, because they're not intimidated by them. If I'm doing 'Boy Meets Grill,' and I do something very simple like grilled hamburgers or steaks or chicken, those are the most sought-after recipes.;Bobby Flay;home
I can't grill vegetables, shellfish or steaks without tongs. Don't bother with those long-handled grilling tongs normally found in the BBQ section of your home store. Get intimate with your grill and opt for the regular stainless steel tongs.;Bobby Flay;home
I think my children know that Mother's priority is to be with them first. But I don't think it has to be an either/or situation. Work is very important to me, and it wouldn't be in the best interest of my children for me to stay home seven days a week.;Jane Pauley;home
Once you're halfway home, you know that you can probably get the rest of the way there.;Janis Ian;home
Most of us in the baby-boom generation were raised by full-time mothers. Even as recently as 14 years ago, 6 out of 10 mothers with babies were staying at home. Today that is totally reversed. Does that mean we love our children less than our mothers loved us? No, but it certainly causes a lot of guilt trips.;Jane Pauley;home
I grew up in a very toxic home.;Bethenny Frankel;home
A nutritionist helps me eat healthily at home.;Leighton Meester;home

I'm very lucky. I am one of those people who is able to go home, shut the front door and completely focus on the kids.;Nick Clegg;home
Acting is probably the greatest therapy in the world. You can get a lot stuff out of you on the set so you don't have to take it home with you at night. It's the stuff between the lines, the empty space between those lines which is interesting.;Robert Carlyle;home
I am reasonably happy. I didn't find Jesus or anything like that. Part of it is that I just feel that I could go home. I did not feel like that for a long time, but I could go back now.;Craig Ferguson;home

The American dream seems to be thriving in Europe not at home.;Fareed Zakaria;home

A kid in an abusive home has far fewer rights than any POW. There is no Geneva Convention for kids.;Andrew Vachss;home

I listen to the phone-ins on the way home and I know how the fans feel.;Steven Gerrard;home

My mom enlisted in the U.S. Navy in World War II, and my parents actually bought our home thanks to the loan she got through the GI Bill.;Thomas Friedman;home
I was not born in a home where there were stereotypes. So that was very useful because it gave me the sense of possibilities, of flying, if I may say, of making my hopes and dreams a reality.;Michelle Bachelet;home
I was a loner as a child and happiest at home, launching toy rockets and aeroplanes. When I started causing trouble in my third year at grammar school, Mum was really surprised. My parents sent me to a child psychologist, who suggested I might have Asperger's syndrome.;Gary Numan;home
I don't know what my label is. I just think of myself as a plain forward. I like to think I have some finesse to my game, but inside the paint is where men are made. If you can't play there, you should be home with your mama.;Karl Malone;home
I'm not afraid to call a wine that tastes like Skittles or green peppers mixed with orange marmalade. I'll say, 'It tastes like chicken.' I mean, that's not what people think of when they think of wine, but that's what it tastes like to me and it hits home.;Gary Vaynerchuk;home
I'm still really close with everyone at home and their parents - and their brothers and sisters. I was so, so, so lucky to grow up as part of a community and I don't take that for granted. I try very hard to stay part of it.;Jennifer Garner;home
And now, I still really don't care that much but now I have music playing all the time at home, which is a first for me. Whatever. Everything from Ani DiFranco to Dave Matthews to Jack Johnson and Norah Jones.;Jennifer Garner;home
There's an internal battle. I need to work, I need to work, I need to work and I need to be home with my kids and the kids win.;Jennifer Garner;home
My sisters both are working mothers. I understand that my being an actress as well as being at home isn't some heroic thing. That doesn't mean it isn't confusing or difficult - especially that question of how you find a balance.;Jennifer Garner;home
This is truly a blessing. Breyon Prescott, Peter Edge and Tom Corson believe in me and have introduced me to a home that also believes and knows exactly what to do with the type of music I'm doing.;Brandy Norwood;home
No, let's make sure that people understand that this is a very important war that is helping to protect us here at home. And that we have no choice but to win it. As difficult as it is.;John Boehner;home
Americans, particularly after World War II, tended to romanticize war because in World War II our cause was the cause of humanity, and our soldiers brought home glory and victory, and thank God that they did. But it led us to romanticize it to some extent.;Neil Sheehan;home
Five thousand people every day lose their home because of a medical bankruptcy. Most of them had insurance.;Debbie Stabenow;home
Every woman I've had a relationship with has found this maddening the fact that I will talk about anything on the stage, and reveal all this stuff, and yet when I'm at home, I clam up and won't discuss anything intimate or personal.;Jarvis Cocker;home
In the holy city of Mecca, violence of any kind was forbidden. From the moment they left home, pilgrims were not permitted to carry weapons, to swat an insect or speak an angry word, a discipline that introduced them to a new way of living.;Karen Armstrong;home
At home in Victoria, we have three dogs, Tosh and Lucy, they're half Blue Heelers, and then there's Torrin a little Maltese terrier. She gets more attention in the house than anyone else! Yes, I miss them a lot.;Chris Hemsworth;home
It's like, now you're actually complaining because you're making $9 million and guys are making more? If it makes you that upset, quit. Leave the game. Go home then and try finding another job that's going to pay you that.;Eric Davis;home
After all, I long to be in America again, nay, if I can go home to return no more to Europe, it seems to me that I shall ever enjoy more peace of mind, and even Physical comfort than I can meet with in any portion of the world beside.;John James Audubon;home
In all honesty, at that time, I never saw myself as an author... I was just a Mom in a state of panic, trying to enter a short story contest to win the prize money in order to keep the lights on in my home.;Leslie Banks;home
It's a sad day when the leaders of the free world engage in such deception and trickery. I voted against this unnecessary war and will continue to argue that the best way to support our troops is to bring them home.;Major R. Owens;home
At one point my dad called me and said, 'You have always been a great salesman. I think it's time you come home and sell swimming pools.';Courteney Cox;home
When I was a kid I didn't feel like I fit in because - this is really silly and I probably shouldn't say it, but, I didn't think anything was funny. So I used to go home and literally cry to my mom and my step-dad at the time and I didn't think anything was funny. I couldn't laugh.;Courteney Cox;home
Great music is its own movie, already. And the challenge, as a music fan, is to keep the song as powerful as it wants to be, to not tamper with it and to somehow give it a home.;Cameron Crowe;home
It's hard for women who make a lot of money and make decisions all day long, then they have to come home and be 'Stupid Sally.' Men need respect, and they need to know that they can lead in the relationship, so even if they don't make the most money they need to be able to call the shots.;Patti Stanger;home
You may not like the idea of putting money into a home when you're moving out. But it's demanded by the market. You need to show it off. You don't have to rip out the kitchen and bathroom. But maybe replace the tiles or the countertops. Get professional advice.;Barbara Corcoran;home
The most influential factor in selling a home is always price. Don't build 'wiggle room' into the asking price. There's a price war out there and you have to win it from the get-go.;Barbara Corcoran;home
I live a dual life. On the red carpet, it's complete glam. But at home, I'm a jeans and T-shirt kind of girl. Simple can be beautiful.;Ashley Greene;home
You can't control the paparazzi. But if you go to Coachella you're going to get photographed. Whereas if you're at home, walking down the street you probably won't. It's something I've learnt to navigate my way around but I try to keep my private life private.;Ashley Greene;home
I speak relatively little, except when I'm at home and I'm asking for things.;Roger Moore;home
When I was at college, I worked in a department store called Brit Home Stores, which is a pretty lackluster department store, selling clothes for middle-aged women. My job was to walk the floor and find anything that was damaged, take it to the store room and log it.;Dominic Monaghan;home
The 4th Amendment and the personal rights it secures have a long history. At the very core stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.;Potter Stewart;home
Home is where my mom is.;Brittany Murphy;home
My home town is very small and very remote and we don't have a movie house.;Tommy Lee Jones;home
Man hath still either toys or care: But hath no root, nor to one place is tied, but ever restless and irregular, about this earth doth run and ride. He knows he hath a home, but scarce knows where He says it is so far, that he has quite forgot how to go there.;Henry Vaughan;home
I practice yoga at home to a TV show called 'Inhale,' taught by Steve Ross. I figured that if the people on the show could stretch that deep then I could too. I ended up pulling my hip flexor. But that's how I met my husband. Paul was the physical therapist my coach called to meet with me after hours.;Danica Patrick;home
Nevertheless most of the evergreen forests of the north must always remain the home of wild animals and trappers, a backward region in which it is easy for a great fur company to maintain a practical monopoly.;Ellsworth Huntington;home
Take, for example, the African jungle, the home of the cheetah. On whom does the cheetah prey? The old, the sick, the wounded, the weak, the very young, but never the strong. Lesson: If you would not be prey, you had better be strong.;G. Gordon Liddy;home
When I was at home, I felt loved and safe. My sisters were always a safe haven for me. I knew they would always play with me and make me feel like I was one of them.;Khloe Kardashian;home
One thing I've been happy as peach pie about - because I'm all about the children and the happiness of a woman because that makes the happiness of the home - is that nannies, day cares and babysitters are all collapsing, which is forcing moms and dads to raise their children at home.;Laura Schlessinger;home
It's easier to date a football player for sure. Football players have one game a week, and they practice every day, but they're all at home. In basketball, they're on the road all the time.;Khloe Kardashian;home
I do have 14 tattoos, but I also do come home every single night and watch reality TV with my cat.;Lea Michele;home
All my day is spent dealing with other people. When I come home I like it to be empty. The presence of others in my house kind of annoys me. I love coming home and shutting the doors. I feel brain dead. I'm relatively available, but not to live with.;Graham Norton;home
I still cook at home. A lot of chefs I think don't cook at home. But I still do, I love cooking at home, I love having friends.;Rene Redzepi;home
I just moved into a new house, so I love spending time at home. Everything for me is all about self-care because I really feel that if I'm at my best, than I'm able to come to my job and really be feeling the best, so if I'm not working out or going on a hike, than I'm at home recharging and cooking dinner and hanging out with my cat.;Lea Michele;home
If you're a misanthrope you stay at home. There are certain writers who really don't like other people. I'm not like that, I don't think.;Paul Theroux;home
Secretly, I'm a real big nerd. I'd rather stay home and play Scrabble than go to a Hollywood party, any day of the week. And I love reading about history and watching the Discovery Channel.;Sprague Grayden;home
When I began to make some money, I really wanted to have a home.;Paul Theroux;home
I am at home in many cultures. I live actively in three continents and I've done that for most of my life, so I just make films as I see the world, and that happens to speak to people. I do things that I want to do.;Mira Nair;home
Sometimes I do envision just being a stay at home mom but not working isn't an option for me currently.;Tori Spelling;home
New York City is home to so many people from so many places and the uniqueness of it is that you never feel a foreigner. English is almost hardly ever heard in the subway. In fact, it's weird.;Mira Nair;home
We have three generations at home, including my father-in-law. I keep a very low profile, and a lot of things I do are very much with the family in mind. I have actually made films with the family around me.;Mira Nair;home
I'm hoping someday that some kid, black or white, will hit more home runs than myself. Whoever it is, I'd be pulling for him.;Hank Aaron;home
This whole head of the home thing has been blown way out of proportion. Some guys just take it way too far. Some parents take it way too far. Yet children need guidance. They need a parent to help and guide them. They also need a friend. They need a confidant.;Donny Osmond;home
You know, the sad thing of post-9/11, which was of course horrific, was that the city in which I felt completely at home for two decades, suddenly people like us - brown people - were looked at as the 'Others.';Mira Nair;home
I play basketball probably four to five days a week when I'm back home.;Josh Hutcherson;home
It's not always possible to sit down and eat at home in this day and age of fast-paced living, but if you are going to eat out, do so as a family and support all the great local places in your areas. I'll still eat at the same diner I did as a kid with my parents.;Michael Symon;home
I don't know of a Democrat - whether they're a conservative, a centrist or a liberal Democrat - that doesn't think that it's important to have quality jobs that pay decent wages so that families can support themselves, so that they can have the dignity of being able to afford health care, put money aside for pension, buy a home.;Tom Vilsack;home
When we started the show, 'Dallas' was known as the city where JFK was assassinated. By the end it was known as JR's home town.;Larry Hagman;home

I like to feel the butterflies in the stomach, I like to go home and have a restless night and wonder how I'm going to be able to accomplish this feat, get jittery. That hunger and those butterflies in the stomach are very essential for all creative people.;Amitabh Bachchan;home
I got a telegraph from my mother who said that my step-father had had a heart attack, come home and earn a living. So I went back to England and the only thing I knew to earn any cash was through hairdressing.;Vidal Sassoon;home
I came home after a year and although my profession was only hairdressing, I knew I could change it.;Vidal Sassoon;home
Recently I heard a 'wise guy' story that I had a party at my home for twenty-five men. It's an interesting story, but I don't know twenty-five men I'd want to invite ta a party.;Joan Crawford;home
But inspiration? - That's when you come home from abroad and are asked: Well, have you found inspiration? - and fortunately you haven't. But the impressions sink in, of course, and may emerge later: None of us has invented the house that was done many thousands of years ago.;Arne Jacobsen;home
I have two homes in Malibu, a home in Canada that I'm building, and I just love pouring my heart out into this part of my life.;Pamela Anderson;home
The coolest thing, and I have it at home, is a huge Hulk Hogan, normal-sized pinball machine. When people come over they play it for hours. When you hit the bumpers and the bells ring it goes, 'Oh yeah!' The whole time you're playing this machine it's yelling and screaming at you, 'What you gonna do, brother?!' I think that's the coolest.;Hulk Hogan;home
To be honest, I find going out pretty scary and intimidating. Got all those people checking you out, with only one purpose: hooking up. I'm quite the dork, I'd rather sit home and play Scrabble. But that doesn't get you a girl, does it?;Wentworth Miller;home
I think any branding for me is band-related. It's really weird to get used to the exposure, because I am a naturally introverted person, and I'm not exactly social. Occasionally I can get comfortable enough to talk, but I spend a lot of my days not talking, especially when I'm at home and not on tour.;Nate Ruess;home
But for me, I thought you made a record, you got on a bus, went out and played your shows and made a lot of money. That was the way it was supposed to go down. But there's a lot more to it than that. There are a lot of early mornings, late nights, a lot of traveling, a lot of being away from home, being away from your family.;Jason Aldean;home
In principle if I could not have a home I wouldn't. But not having a home would be too difficult procedurally, going from hotel to hotel, the gap of three hours where you're hungry and tired.;Lee Child;home
Reading the play at home, however fulfilling, can never be the vivacious experience that Shakespeare intended.;Arthur Smith;home
I have a little kitchen office at home, where I do all my kids' stuff.;Katey Sagal;home
I think the advent of the Internet gave us all a big boost, because by the time the Internet became mainstream and you could get it in your home, a lot of us were used to dealing in fan culture, writing to magazines or anything at the back of comic books.;Kevin Smith;home
Well, I'm not good with sliminess. I hate the thought of creatures that have slime on them or creatures that leave a slimy trail. At home, the sight of a slug can bring up my breakfast.;Jenny Eclair;home
I think it's really important to give yourself a very big question that you're working on that you can come home to, even if you, you know, are going to have to go without a cup of coffee or even a meal, that that should nourish you.;Anna Deavere Smith;home
I was from such a large family that when I first met my wife, I told her: 'You can go work outside of the house and I'll stay home and continue making my cartoon strips. Maybe I'll make some commercials nearby, you know I'll do anything locally, but I would love to just stay at home and raise the kids like I did when I was growing up.';Robert Rodriguez;home
I made a real specific decision when I came out of school and most artists were writing about home - if you were a woman, you were writing about being a woman - and I decided not to do that, write about what you know. That's not what I do. I went as far away from home as possible in terms of the development of my imagination.;Anna Deavere Smith;home
I love my parents. But I'm almost 28 and it's not fun to be asked, 'What are you doing today? What do you want for dinner? When are you going to be home?' It just makes you feel like a kid. It's this juxtaposition of feeling annoyed and really lucky to have people who love you so much.;Jonah Hill;home
Christianity is not about religion. It's about faith, about being held, about being forgiven. It's about finding joy and finding home.;Bear Grylls;home
I'm always amazed when a pitcher becomes angry at a hitter for hitting a home run off him. When I strike out, I don't get angry at the pitcher, I get angry at myself. I would think that if a pitcher threw up a home run ball, he should be angry at himself.;Willie Stargell;home
I love home cooking, and I'm not a great one for fast food.;Bear Grylls;home
I try and eat really healthy when I'm home, but I certainly don't eat worms and snakes.;Bear Grylls;home
I exercise about 40 minutes a day, and I'll run one day and do circuit training the next day. I live in an area where there are brilliant hills and mountains, so I get a good hill run with my dog. At home, I'll do the circuit training with old weights, along with pull-ups in the trees and that sort of stuff.;Bear Grylls;home
When I'm filming, survival requires movement. You need your energy, and you've got to eat the bad stuff, and survival food is rarely pretty, but you kind of do it. I get in that zone, and I eat the nasty stuff, but I'm not like that when I'm back home.;Bear Grylls;home
Survival requires us to leave our prejudices at home. It's about doing whatever it takes - and ultimately those with the biggest heart will win.;Bear Grylls;home
I only scream and scratch when something's only 'really good' or 'good', I want to be great, or let's go home.;Jeremy Renner;home

Nice to see your home fans boo you. That's what loyal support is.;Wayne Rooney;home
About 15 years ago I went though a period of a year or so when I just couldn't find anything good. My wife noticed I was having trouble reading menus. I bought some cheap reading glasses in a drug store. I got home and suddenly all these books that weren't good were good.;Richard Russo;home
The American consumer is also the American worker, and if we don't do something to protect our manufacturing base here at home, it is going to be hard to buy any retail goods.;Lindsey Graham;home
I went to the store and bought lady fingers, when I got home I noticed one of the fingers was missing so I went back to the store and the manager was nice enough to give me the finger.;Jay London;home
Brazil is where I belong, the place that feels like home. They love their family, their country and God, and are not afraid to let anybody know it.;Dionne Warwick;home
At home, growing up, we weren't really poor. We had everything we needed, we just didn't have what we wanted.;Barbara Kingsolver;home
He's a good tough producer, yes. But I don't think that he's unreasonable unless he feels threatened. And when somebody's in your home, I think everybody in the home gets threatened.;Liza Minnelli;home
I lived at home till I was 29.;Ray Romano;home
My folks were raised pure prohibitionist. They were very good people, with high moral standards - but very repressed. There was no hugging and kissing in my home.;Hugh Hefner;home
Men can have a huge turnover of sponsorship and still survive a lot better than the women. But the women's ratings are better, at least at home in the United States than in the men's tennis.;Billie Jean King;home
I'd rather rot on my own floor than be found by a bunch of bingo players in a nursing home.;Florence King;home
I read the Odyssey because it was the story of a man who returned home after being absent for more than twenty years and was recognized only by his dog.;Guillermo Cabrera Infante;home
On my visits back home, if they saw that I was getting a big head, they'd let me know right away.;John Ratzenberger;home
Ladies and gentlemen, god bless America - land of the free, home of the brave.;Dave Grohl;home
For President Obama, 'home of the brave' are not just the last words of our national anthem, but also a call to action. This is why the president's policies and our platform include incentives to train and hire our troops returning home. Not only because of our moral responsibility, but because it makes for a stronger, more secure American economy.;Cory Booker;home
It's not about finding a home so much as finding yourself.;Jason Behr;home
I spend plenty of time in London and it doesn't scare me, but it's a lonely place, even if you've got friends there. My job takes me all around the world, meeting lots of interesting people. But I think if I couldn't get home, if I couldn't get back to what I consider my real life I'd be frightened.;Shirley Henderson;home
My wife is the boss at home, and my daughters are the bosses. I am just the worker. We are a very warm family and very happy.;Jet Li;home
Leaving home in a sense involves a kind of second birth in which we give birth to ourselves.;Robert Neelly Bellah;home
Every time I took a long leave from home, I felt as if I were going to conquer the world. Or rather, take possession of what is my birthright, my inheritance.;Ella Maillart;home
But, yeah, I'm really happy when I'm writing. When I'm being creative and when I have something that I can put down. You know, if you go out and you overhear a conversation or you have a thought, you have a receptacle to go home and say, 'Oh, this would be great in this script.' Your antenna's out in a different way, and I love that time.;Josh Radnor;home
I do 280 episodes of TV a year, write 15 recipes for the magazine, and publish an annual book. With all of that, we try to get one weekend a month with Isaboo at our home in the Adirondacks to relax and recharge.;Rachael Ray;home
I live in, literally, the same home when I was swiping my first bank card and wondering if I'd have to put back the Charmin. We still don't have a dishwasher. My mom has done all these gardens so now my house looks like the garden shack in the middle of Versailles.;Rachael Ray;home
I have this extraordinary life during the day, and then I get to come home to my sweet husband who loves to cook with me. I have a nice glass of wine, he has some scotch, we chat, we cook, and we hang out with the dog. I have an absolute dream life.;Rachael Ray;home
Good food and a warm kitchen are what makes a house a home. I always tried to make my home like my mother's, because Mom was magnificent at stretching a buck when it came to decorating and food. Like a true Italian, she valued beautification in every area of her life, and I try to do the same.;Rachael Ray;home
Praying privately in churches, I began to discover that heaven was my true home and also that it was here and now, woven into this life.;Lionel Blue;home

I came from a broken home, so my mom was a major influence in my life.;Julius Erving;home

I had to learn to dance for 'The Adjustment Bureau' and it was nearly impossible. I turned up with my knees knocking in my leotard and went home and cried my eyes out.;Emily Blunt;home
I hate formal stuff. I love looking like a doll and all that stuff and playing dress up, but when I'm home, sweat pants, t-shirt. When I'm in the studio, sweat pants, t-shirt.;Nicki Minaj;home
The culture is going into a psychological depression. We are concerned about our place in the world, about being competitive: Will my children have as much as I have? Will I ever own my own home? How can I pay for a new car? Are immigrants taking away my white world?;James Hillman;home
I buy records - vinyl. I have a record player at home.;Amber Heard;home
One of the biggest challenges in my job is letting go of the movie once you go home at night, and knowing you can't do anything to your performance once you've laid it on film.;Amber Heard;home
There are no college courses to build up self-esteem or high school or elementary school. If you don't get those values at a early age, nurtured in your home, you don't get them.;T. D. Jakes;home
I love being on stage if I'm not on a set. If I'm at home, I'm usually in my office editing or reconstructing my website or whatever it may be. I just love putting creativity into a performance, so if the right script comes along, and I certainly am reading comedies and dramas now, then I'm ready willing and able to give it a shot.;Dane Cook;home
I do portraits. I usually do live models in a class environment, but I've been painting at home more. I really love the human form, and I love faces. I've tried to do landscapes a few times.;Michelle Pfeiffer;home
I've gone very far, far away, but my character keeps me close to home.;Fran Drescher;home
During the periods in my marriage when I chose to stay home with my kids rather than work as an attorney, it caused me no end of anxiety. Despite the fact that I knew I was contributing to our family by caring for our children, I still felt that my worth was less because I wasn't earning.;Ayelet Waldman;home
Why go for a costly, sickly, mass-produced purebred when shelters are full of one-of-a-kind mixed breeds who are literally dying for a home?;Ingrid Newkirk;home

A beautiful bouquet or a long-lasting flowering plant is a traditional gift for women, but I have recommended that both men and women keep fresh flowers in the home for their beauty, fragrance, and the lift they give our spirits.;Andrew Weil;home
Part of the reason I sort of shot out like a cannon out of Michigan and left home at such an early age is because I had to feel independent.;Madonna Ciccone;home

Turn up the lights. I don't want to go home in the dark.;O. Henry;home
Divorce is one of the key predictors of poverty for a child growing up in a home that's broken.;Mike Huckabee;home
I support workplace clean air. But a federal ban on smoking would mean that you couldn't smoke in your own home. I don't care what people do in their home.;Mike Huckabee;home
It's like, if you can't focus on a movie for 90 minutes without looking at your phone, then don't go to the movies! You've got some issues, so you should probably stay home and work on those issues, and not distract everyone with lights, and sounds, oh my gosh, the tapping on the screens, it makes me crazy!;Ginnifer Goodwin;home
I'm a better person in a relationship, and I'm a happier person. I need to come home at the end of the day and have it not be about me and my freaking hair and makeup and character motivations anymore. And I think my work is more inspired when home is safe and sound and solid, because what I do for a living is so bananas and so insecure.;Ginnifer Goodwin;home
I will end up with someone in the arts. I am positive. I eat, breathe and sleep acting. And I'll end up with someone who is happy staying at home and having me cook supper. But I also really need to be intellectually challenged and stimulated. I want someone bookish, and someone who is passionate.;Ginnifer Goodwin;home
After spending time with the rescued turkeys at Farm Sanctuary's shelter and seeing how similar they are to my furry companion animals at home, I knew I needed to do everything in my power to protect these friendly and curious birds from the daily pain and suffering they endure on factory farms.;Ginnifer Goodwin;home

To the former child migrants, who came to Australia from a home far away, led to believe this land would be a new beginning, when only to find it was not a beginning, but an end, an end of innocence - we apologise and we are sorry. To the mothers who lost the maternal right to love and care for their child - we apologise, and we are sorry.;Malcolm Turnbull;home
My father was always depressed. When he was home and sober, he was mostly in his room.;Sherman Alexie;home
I think it's easiest to teach by example. My dad didn't tell us to work hard we just saw how hard he worked. I know I have shortcomings - like a short fuse - but I've learned you can't come home from a long day of work and snap at the kids.;Chris O'Donnell;home
Imagine if you had baseball cards that showed all the performance stats for your people: batting averages, home runs, errors, ERAs, win/loss records. You could see what they did well and poorly and call on the right people to play the right positions in a very transparent way.;Ray Dalio;home

You know, it shouldn't just be about women as heroic figures overcoming things, it just needs to be about women in general getting the opportunity to play a multitude of roles, telling a multitude of stories - just to express human experience from a woman's perspective. I hope, someday, we can get to that point. I'm all about representation.;Diablo Cody;hope

I had a huge advantage when I started 50 years ago - my job was secure. I didn't have to promote myself.

There is something uniquely depressing about the fact that the National Portrait Gallery's version of the Barack Obama 'Hope' poster previously belonged to a pair of lobbyists.

I mean, I get letters in the mail because I had a heart defect when I was one, I had surgeries and stuff.

I mean, why am I considered an 'it girl?' Because I'm in a lot of movies right now or am on the covers of magazines? I just hope there is something solid behind that.

I hope in my lifetime we can all continue to laugh at ourselves and not put down anyone for what they weigh.;Richard Simmons;hope

Hope is independent of the apparatus of logic.;Norman Cousins;hope
With optimism, you look upon the sunny side of things. People say, 'Studs, you're an optimist.' I never said I was an optimist. I have hope because what's the alternative to hope? Despair? If you have despair, you might as well put your head in the oven.;Studs Terkel;hope
We are biological creatures. We are born, we live, we die. There is no transcendent purpose to existence.

When you put something out there into the world, there's all these words you don't want to hear, that you hope people don't say. I don't like anything that starts with 're' - like retro, reinvent, recreate - I hate that. It's always like living in the past - copying, emulating.;Jack White;hope

Pity the selfishness of lovers: it is brief, a forlorn hope it is impossible.;Elizabeth Bowen;hope

They have a kind of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby thing going on.;Christopher Walken;hope
One of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation.;Thomas Reed;hope
I've flown across America, I've scaled fences, I've stood under windows and gone out of my way hundreds of times. I'm a hopeless romantic. There's no hope for me.;Joel Madden;hope
Do you force your kids to pay attention to what's going on, or do you let them live their lives outside of it? My hope is that my child is a strong activist. That would make me most proud.;Eddie Vedder;hope
My hope is that people will be repulsed by the character's complete lack of ethics and obsession with consumerism - that's what I was saying about the difference between the character's message and the film's message.;Christian Bale;hope
I hope to inspire people, influence people.;Ashley Tisdale;hope
There is nothing so well known as that we should not expect something for nothing - but we all do and call it Hope.;E. W. Howe;hope

What I hope in my ideal world is that with each project, I'll either get to work with a really great script that would force me to grow, or work with a really great actor who will make me better.;Laura Linney;hope
I hope that anyone I worked with wouldn't exploit our relationship.;Laura Linney;hope
Most people like to read about intrigue and spies. I hope to provide a metaphor for the average reader's daily life. Most of us live in a slightly conspiratorial relationship with our employer and perhaps with our marriage.;John le Carre;hope
I don't want to make films that give you the answer. If there is a message to my films - and I hope there isn't - it's to be open-minded.;Jason Reitman;hope
When you're young, you want to make every kind of film: musicals, Westerns, horror. Slowly you begin to hear your own voice. I hope people receive what I do as small, personal films that are somewhat contrarian about their main characters.;Jason Reitman;hope
So, influenced by these advisors and this hope, I have at length allowed my friends to publish the work, as they had long besought me to do.;Nicolaus Copernicus;hope

For a person who promised hope and civility in politics, Mr. Obama has shown a borderline obsessiveness in blaming Mr. Bush.;Karl Rove;hope
When it's said and done, the one thing I want to leave on this earth is hope. I have felt hopelessness, and it's a terrible feeling. Hopelessness will destroy you. I want to bring hope to other people.;Paula Deen;hope
My hope is that I will take the good from my experiences and extrapolate them further into areas with which I am unfamiliar. I simply do not know exactly what that difference will be in my judging. But I accept there will be some based on my gender and my Latina heritage.;Sonia Sotomayor;hope
I've tried to handle winning well, so that maybe we'll win again, but I've also tried to handle failure well. If those serve as good examples for teachers and kids, then I hope that would be a contribution I have made to sport. Not just basketball, but to sport.;Mike Krzyzewski;hope
To eat bread without hope is still slowly to starve to death.;Pearl S. Buck;hope
Change is not a destination, just as hope is not a strategy.;Rudy Giuliani;hope

Hope is the feeling that the feeling you have isn't permanent.;Jean Kerr;hope
You don't seem to realize that a poor person who is unhappy is in a better position than a rich person who is unhappy. Because the poor person has hope. He thinks money would help.;Jean Kerr;hope
There's always hope. You can lose everything else in the world, but Jews never lose hope.;Jonathan Sacks;hope
That's what's nice about directing a film and having it done: There's nothing more I can do about it. It's done. That's it. All I can do is let it go and hope that people are kind to it.;Tom Hanks;hope
When I was teaching in the 1960s in Boston, there was a great deal of hope in the air. Martin Luther King Jr. was alive, Malcolm X was alive great, great leaders were emerging from the southern freedom movement.;Jonathan Kozol;hope
The contrasts between what is spent today to educate a child in the poorest New York City neighborhoods, where teacher salaries are often even lower than the city averages, and spending levels in the wealthiest suburban areas are daunting challenges to any hope New Yorkers might retain that even semblances of fairness still prevail.;Jonathan Kozol;hope
If we all worked on the assumption that what is accepted as true is really true, there would be little hope of advance.;Orville Wright;hope
I don't want to hope anymore. I don't think we should hope anymore. We hoped enough. Now we have to do. We all have to do now.;will.i.am;hope
The poor prey on one another because their lives offer no hope and communicate the tragic message to these human beings that they have no possibility to attain a decent standard of living.;Thabo Mbeki;hope
I never make a movie for awards consideration. I will use the hope of getting an Academy Award a) to honor the people who work so hard and also b) it's the greatest Good Housekeeping seal in the world. It's the greatest brand. It's as good as Louis Vuitton and Dior in the world of moviemaking. It's the Super Bowl.;Harvey Weinstein;hope
I hope to continue my friendship with France and its filmmakers for many years to come.;Harvey Weinstein;hope
I would hope that understanding and reconciliation are not limited to the 19th hole alone.;Gerald R. Ford;hope

I hope I left behind a legacy that people will enjoy. But whatever they want to say, I can't predict.;Robert Duvall;hope

I don't know how many good books I still have in me I hope there are another four or five.;Haruki Murakami;hope

To my utter despair I have discovered, and discover every day anew, that there is in the masses no revolutionary idea or hope or passion.;Mikhail Bakunin;hope
It has never been, and never will be easy work! But the road that is built in hope is more pleasant to the traveler than the road built in despair, even though they both lead to the same destination.;Marion Zimmer Bradley;hope
You never know what movie I will be in next, but let's just hope it's sells (for my sake at least)!;Cameron Diaz;hope
What can you do if a part of it is uphill? You can't work out another route. You've just got to run the one they give you. But they tell me London is a nice course. Even the cobbles, I hope, are not very much of a problem for me.;Haile Gebrselassie;hope
Nothing you write, if you hope to be good, will ever come out as you first hoped.;Lillian Hellman;hope

There is no hope even that woman, with her right to vote, will ever purify politics.;Emma Goldman;hope
I think by now I have made it fairly clear that I am not very happy with the word hope. I don't believe in people just hoping.;Aung San Suu Kyi;hope
My opinion is the greatest reward that any government could get is the approval of the people. If the people are happy and the people are at peace and the government has done something for them, that's the greatest reward I think any government could hope for.;Aung San Suu Kyi;hope
To communicate the truths of history is an act of hope for the future.;Daisaku Ikeda;hope
There are a lot of movies I'd like to throw away. That's not to say that I went in with that attitude. Any film I ever started, I went in with all the hope and best intentions in the world, but some films just don't work.;Kiefer Sutherland;hope
The other day I got a text from a boy, but it wasn't hot. I mean, if you're going to text me every day, you haven't seen me for months and you're trying to seduce me, you'd better spice up that text and make it more exciting than 'How was your day? I hope you're having a beautiful one.' Sadly, I haven't been doing a lot of kissing lately.;Chloe Sevigny;hope
I hope that through my example, such as my role on 'The West Wing,' I can help change attitudes on deafness and prove we can really do everything... except hear.;Marlee Matlin;hope
I hope I'm not a tourist attraction - I'm sure that they come here really because St. Andrews is just amazing, a beautiful place.;Prince William;hope
I have learned from my experiences in this industry that there is absolutely no way to control people's opinions on your performance in your movie. You go out there, promote your film and hope people like the work you did.;Leonardo DiCaprio;hope
I love Bono. I really respect what he has done for Africa and how he has used his fame to do good in the world. I hope I can do half as much in my life.;Alicia Keys;hope
Over the past few years, the road to confrontation has shown its consequences: loss of innocent lives, destruction and fear. Most costly, however, was the loss of hope. The most precious gift that you can present to your peoples over the coming weeks is renewed hope born out of tangible progress on the ground.;King Abdullah II;hope
Is Israel going to continue to be 'Fortress Israel'? Or, as we all hope, become accepted into the neighborhood, which I believe is the only way we can move forward in harmony.;King Abdullah II;hope
I hope that none of the countries in the Middle East are planning anything but the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy.;King Abdullah II;hope
At the end of the day we want to bring stability and hope to Iraq. That's the only way to defeat terrorism.;King Abdullah II;hope

You have to trust your kids. They have to experience life, and you just hope you've provided them a foundation for what's right and what isn't.;Jack Nicklaus;hope
I am not afraid of dying. I have lived longer than most people in the world. What scares me is to have a body that works but a brain that is waving goodbye. If that happens, I hope I die quickly.;Henning Mankell;hope
In the kind of world we have today, transformation of humanity might well be our only real hope for survival.;Stanislav Grof;hope
Looking after my health today gives me a better hope for tomorrow.;Anne Wilson Schaef;hope
I hope by the time I'm 30 to have a husband and maybe a baby.;Vanessa Hudgens;hope
They who do not understand that a man may be brought to hope that which of all things is the most grievous to him, have not observed with sufficient closeness the perversity of the human mind.;Anthony Trollope;hope
In both children and adults, there can be a hard-to-deny link between a robust sense of hope and either work productivity or academic achievement.;Jeffrey Kluger;hope
It's far too much to say that effective hoping is the only - or even the biggest - part of what it takes to succeed. If 14% of business productivity can be attributed to hope, that means 86% is dependent on raw talent, fickle business cycles, the quality of the product you're selling, and often pure, dumb luck.;Jeffrey Kluger;hope
It seems to me there is a change in what audiences want to see. I can only hope that's correct, because there's an awful lot of people of my age around now and we outnumber the others.;Maggie Smith;hope
Today is a celebration of hope for the Iraqi people. The Iraqi people can now take control of their government and their future by creating a society that protects the rights endowed to us by our creator - life, liberty and freedom.;Jim DeMint;hope
Yes, I've listened to just a few audiobooks - but hope to listen to more. I've wanted to investigate how my own books sound in this format and find the experience of listening, and not reading, quite fascinating.;Joyce Carol Oates;hope
I have more awareness of other people and, I hope, more sensitivity to their needs. I also find that I'm more direct and outspoken.;Christopher Reeve;hope
I do sometimes strongly hope that in a past life, my most recent life before this, I was absolutely horrible, evil, hideous. Because otherwise - well, hell, to even things up next time around, I'm going to have to pay for this one, am I not?;Vanessa Paradis;hope
I have always striven to raise the voice of hope for a world where hate gives way to respect and oppression to liberation.;Theodore Bikel;hope
One of the principal goals in my life has been to avoid embarrassing my children by doing the job I do. I hope I've managed to do that, and I hope that, with the job I'm in now, they are, if not proud, at least unembarrassed by it. I must say, my three are most agreeable children, who do nothing but delight me.;Hugh Laurie;hope
Hope is a necessity for normal life and the major weapon against the suicide impulse.;Karl A. Menninger;hope
I hope the Guggenheim plan will be revived.;David Rockefeller;hope
My hope and prayer is that the body of Christ in America will awake with holy boldness, a boldness content neither with silence nor mere words but that backs up those words with action and results.;Frank R. Wolf;hope
I suppose if I'd got a brilliant first and done research I might still be a don today, but I hope not. People become dons because they are incapable of doing anything else in life.;A. N. Wilson;hope
I hope to one day co-sign a lease with another person but, well, it doesn't plague me that I have yet to do so. Put it this way: I've never had to violently tug at my own pillow at 2 A.M. to get myself to stop snoring.;Sloane Crosley;hope
I love being able to sing for my job. I am blessed beyond words and I hope my fans can feel that while I'm on stage!;Jordin Sparks;hope
I really feel confident about my dancing now, so I hope there could be a place for me in the West End or on Broadway - maybe a musical, maybe my own show.;Katherine Jenkins;hope
Overcoming the Cold War required courage from the people of Central and Eastern Europe and what was then the German Democratic Republic, but it also required the steadfastness of Western partner over many decades when many had long lost hope of integration of the two Germanys and Europe.;Angela Merkel;hope
It was an amazing adventure, it was my dream to be in an American musical... I really hope you are going to love what you are going to see.;Marion Cotillard;hope
I never read the life of any important person without discovering that he knew more and could do more than I could ever hope to know or do in half a dozen lifetimes.;J. B. Priestley;hope
We need to have a pro-growth policy put in place that offers people hope and offers the opportunity for businesses to expand and for them to have confidence in what the world is going to look like for the next two or three or four years with respect to economic policy.;Dick Cheney;hope
I am proud to have been capable of giving people hope again.;Francois Hollande;hope
I know where I'm going and I have told the French. I am sure if hope is there, we will be able to put France back on its feet... to live better in five years than we do today.;Francois Hollande;hope
There are hurdles, there are handicaps, hardships you have to face in life, but you hope for a great future.;Anil Kapoor;hope
It's always been my hope, as an actor, to reveal only what is relevant about myself to the work.;Eric Bana;hope
If you're lucky enough to be involved in a film that's about something very real and that you hope will continue to hold up in 20 years' time it just gives you more energy and makes it feel all the more worthwhile.;Eric Bana;hope
Politics is not predictions and politics is not observations. Politics is what we do. Politics is what we do, politics is what we create, by what we work for, by what we hope for and what we dare to imagine.;Paul Wellstone;hope
I hope I'm still shooting when I'm 80.;Conrad Hall;hope
The history of our country is cruel. We have to face those issues or, should I say, we had to. Not anymore I hope, because we are going in the right direction, and we are ready to forgive, ready to move on.;Novak Djokovic;hope
Most American fascists are enthusiastically supporting the war effort. They are doing this even in those cases where they hope to have profitable connections with German chemical firms after the war ends.;Henry A. Wallace;hope
I think almost every writer in the world would hope that books would be always talked about with respect and civility and depth and seriousness.;Dave Eggers;hope
A man can stand a lot as long as he can stand himself. He can live without hope, without friends, without books, even without music, as long as he can listen to his own thoughts.;Axel Munthe;hope
I'm constantly thinking about what I'll do next. I never count on music being a career of longevity. I mean, longevity is key, and I hope that it lasts, but you just don't know, because it's not in your hands, you don't make the decision.;Beth Ditto;hope
Jim Thorpe is someone I've always loved. He was an Olympic athlete, you know, and a football player from back in the day. I'd love to play him. And then there's a guy called Iceman who was a top hit man for the mob. I would love to play him. Actually, it's sort of in the works, so I hope it goes through.;Channing Tatum;hope
'A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints' was the first real actor-actor part I did, and I hope I to do more. Action movies are fun, but I'd be happy not to do them if there are better roles.;Channing Tatum;hope
I think the way IBM has embraced the open source philosophy has been quite astonishing, but gratifying. I hope they'll do very well with it.;Larry Wall;hope
Hope is such a bait, it covers any hook.;Oliver Goldsmith;hope
As a relatively young woman - I'm 33 - I hope to one day have a family and already have commitments. If and when I'm elected as an MP, I would face a choice: take my family with me to London each week or be apart for four, maybe five, nights a week.;Lucy Powell;hope
I just hope that the democratic will of the Zimbabwean people prevails. If it does we must move quickly to help restore stability and prosperity.;Lucy Powell;hope
Hope is like a harebell trembling from its birth.;Christina Rossetti;hope
She gave up beauty in her tender youth, gave all her hope and joy and pleasant ways she covered up her eyes lest they should gaze on vanity, and chose the bitter truth.;Christina Rossetti;hope
I prefer to win titles with the team ahead of individual awards or scoring more goals than anyone else. I'm more worried about being a good person than being the best football player in the world. When all this is over, what are you left with? When I retire, I hope I am remembered for being a decent guy.;Lionel Messi;hope
I hope to find the roles that are age appropriate but not yearning to be younger, or parenting ad nauseam.;Debra Winger;hope
When you are kind to someone in trouble, you hope they'll remember and be kind to someone else. And it'll become like a wildfire.;Whoopi Goldberg;hope
What I hope is in five years' time, I can go to the British people in the election and say: Lots of you doubted that coalition politics worked, but it has worked.;Nick Clegg;hope
I don't know now if I'm funny. I just keep talking and hope that I hit something that's funny.;Craig Ferguson;hope
I hope what I do has an art to it, and as an artist you have to try new things and keep yourself entertained.;Craig Ferguson;hope
I don't want to say never, but I hope I don't become that 'take me seriously now' guy.;Trey Parker;hope
My fear is that, as soon as I get married and have kids that I'll kind of do what a lot of people do and suddenly start making, 'Now I'm gonna make films for kids.' I really hope I don't do that.;Trey Parker;hope
I hope we never get to the point that we put ourselves in Jesus' place. But when I read the New Testament basically, we get three mandates: to love God, to love each other, and to take care of the least among us. And I think this is at least a step in the right direction.;Bob Riley;hope
For many in baseball September is a month of stark contrast with April, when everyone had dared to hope. If baseball is a lot like life, as pundits declare, it is because life is more about losing than winning.;John Thorn;hope
Television has spread the habit of instant reaction and stimulated the hope of instant results.;Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.;hope
One of the things I like best about 'Biggest Loser' is being around people who are trying to make the right choices. When you feel defeated about your weight and your health, like there's no hope, and you still make the choice to fight for it, to make the change happen no matter what people say or think, that's inspiring to me.;Alison Sweeney;hope
You have to have hope. It's irresponsible to give false hope, which I think a lot of playwrights are guilty of. But I also think it's irresponsible to simply be a nihilist, which quite a lot of playwrights, especially playwrights younger than me, have become guilty of.;Tony Kushner;hope
If you know that life is basically going to be horrendously difficult, at best, and all but unlivable at worst, or possibly even unlivable, do you go on? And the choice to go on is the only thing that I think can be called hope. Because if hope isn't forced to encounter the worst possibility, then it's a lie.;Tony Kushner;hope
As I travel across the country speaking about MS, perhaps I can offer others comfort and hope.;Annette Funicello;hope
I think we have lost our groove as a country. One of the reasons was the attack on 9/11. We got knocked off our game. From a country that always exported hope we went into the business of exporting fear.;Thomas Friedman;hope
People see I am a mother and head of a household. Today in Chile, one-third of households are run by women. They wake up, take the children to school, go to work. To them I am hope.;Michelle Bachelet;hope
Hope is a very unruly emotion.;Gloria Steinem;hope
I hope for peace and sanity - it's the same thing.;Studs Terkel;hope
I think it's realistic to have hope. One can be a perverse idealist and say the easiest thing: 'I despair. The world's no good.' That's a perverse idealist. It's practical to hope, because the hope is for us to survive as a human species. That's very realistic.;Studs Terkel;hope
We use the word 'hope' perhaps more often than any other word in the vocabulary: 'I hope it's a nice day.' 'Hopefully, you're doing well.' 'So how are things going along? Pretty good. Going to be good tomorrow? Hope so.';Studs Terkel;hope
I hope to be around past the 90's. I don't want to just be categorized as one of this era. My goal is to have a career that stands.;Mariah Carey;hope
We hope President Obama will now respect the will of the people, change course, and commit to making the changes they are demanding. To the extent he is willing to do this, we are ready to work with him.;John Boehner;hope
House and Senate Republicans are now united in adopting earmark bans. We hope President Obama will follow through on his support for an earmark ban by pressing Democratic leaders to join House and Senate Republicans in taking this critical step to restore public trust.;John Boehner;hope
If there is to be any hope of prosperity for this country it is by reversing that policy which made us simply the kitchen garden for supplying the British with cheap food.;Eamon de Valera;hope
I love the Beatles. I haven't named any kids after them but I still really love them. They were the first group that I was ever properly aware of. In my early teens I would sometimes stay in and listen to the radio all day in the hope that I would catch a song by them that I'd never heard before and be able to tape it on my radio-cassette player.;Jarvis Cocker;hope
I am proud, and more than a little excited, to be asked to work with Faber in an editorial capacity. It is my dearest hope that we will produce some fantastic books together.;Jarvis Cocker;hope
For myself, if I am to stake all I have and hope to be upon anything, I will venture it upon the abounding fullness of God - upon the assurance that, as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are His ways higher than our ways, and His thoughts than our thoughts.;Henry Norris Russell;hope
I hope to have one more boxing match at the age of 55. Given that demographic at the age of 55 to 65, you've got to make a statement with your life. Otherwise, you are just existing.;George Foreman;hope
I'm really happy here. I think anyone who knows me well, and the fans too I hope, they know that I love the area, and the bond that I've had with the fans has been fantastic.;Frank Lampard;hope
I hope to make movies that are so small they don't need to make anything to be profitable.;J. J. Abrams;hope
Flying back from New York, the flight attendant said 'God, I wished you were here yesterday, we had a stroke on the plane. I said, if I have a stroke on a plane, I hope the pretend doctor isn't the one on the plane. I want a real doctor.;Anthony Edwards;hope
I think films have to reach people and really grab them. That's what I hope to do when I make a film - to get under your skin and really make you think about something, and have a transporting time that takes you somewhere.;Mira Nair;hope
Journalists say a thing that they know isn't true, in the hope that if they keep on saying it long enough it will be true.;Arnold Bennett;hope
There was a moment in my life when I really wanted to kill myself. And there was one other moment when I was close to that. But even in my most jaded times, I had some hope.;Gerard Way;hope
So we just hope that all of these governors who are grappling will be able to provide the basic services to our citizens and not have to cut things that really are painful.;Jennifer Granholm;hope
There's hope for everyone. That's what makes the world go round.;Paul Auster;hope
I think sometimes all you need is to hear someone else say the same thing that you're going through to realize that you're not alone. I try to put some sense of hope into the songs, into whatever the situation is so that it's not just dirt, drudgery and a life of misery.;Sarah McLachlan;hope
I hope to be an actor and never retire.;Dominic Monaghan;hope
Everybody, sooner or later, will have to go under the knife. Let's hope they make out as well as I did.;Bobby Darin;hope
My book 'Trust Your Heart', which is the story of my life, will be followed by 'Singing Lessons', a memoir of love, loss, hope, and healing, which talks about the death of my son and the hope that has been the aftermath of the healing from that tragedy.;Judy Collins;hope
The moment that changed me for ever was the moment my first child was born. I was happy, filled with hope, and thought, 'Now I understand the whole point of work, of life, of love.';Paul Theroux;hope
Now science has presented us with a hope called stem cell research, which may provide our scientists with many answers that have for so long been beyond our grasp.;Nancy Reagan;hope
You cannot set art off in a corner and hope for it to have vitality, reality, and substance.;Charles Ives;hope
But what I hope for from a book - either one that I write or one that I read - is transparency. I want the story to shine through. I don't want to think of the writer.;Anne Tyler;hope
I hope to stay unemployed as a war photographer till the end of my life.;Robert Capa;hope
There is no word for feeling nostalgic about the future, but that's what a parent's tears often are, a nostalgia for something that has not yet occurred. They are the pain of hope, the helplessness of hope, and finally, the surrender to hope.;Michael Ian Black;hope
People tend to overstate my resilience, but, of course, I hope they're right.;David Brudnoy;hope
I do insist on making what I hope is sense so there's always a coherent narrative or argument that the reader can follow.;Howard Nemerov;hope
I don't believe that I'm better than anybody, but I do believe that I'll try harder than most and I hope that people just join me for a little bit of a ride.;Tom DeLonge;hope
When I am dead, I hope it may be said: His sins were scarlet, but his books were read.;Hilaire Belloc;hope
Music is something that always lifts my spirits and makes me happy, and when I make music I always hope it will have the same effect on whoever listens to it.;Aaron Carter;hope
Few people know so clearly what they want. Most people can't even think what to hope for when they throw a penny in a fountain.;Barbara Kingsolver;hope
It doesn't matter that the way of life shown by Hollywood was phony. It helped you hope.;Manuel Puig;hope
Ironically, Latin American countries, in their instability, give writers and intellectuals the hope that they are needed.;Manuel Puig;hope
I hope I can help guys come out and say, 'All right, dude, I got a manicure... and I liked it.';Ryan Seacrest;hope
I think it's impossible to judge whether another person should come out. You just hope they will on their own time and their own terms.;Billie Jean King;hope
If we are going to stay a great power and I hope and pray we will we need the truth. We need to know what is going right and we need to know what is going wrong. There is no greater time than now.;Charles Schumer;hope
It's part of the calling to at least do a few songs in the show that give people some hope. There's so much hurt in this world and... music is such a great healing balm and a great way to forget your troubles.;Ricky Skaggs;hope
I told the President, I told Rahm Emanuel and others in the administration that I thought the policy they took to try to bring about negotiations is counter-productive, because when you give the Palestinians hope that the United States will do its negotiating for them, they are not going to sit down and talk.;Charles Schumer;hope
It would be fun to do a reunion show. I hope we do it some day, but it better be soon. We're all getting on.;William Christopher;hope
If one seeks to analyze experiences and reactions to the first postwar years, I hope one may say without being accused of bias that it is easier for the victor than for the vanquished to advocate peace.;Gustav Stresemann;hope
TV is so different from the movies. It takes a lot of stamina because you work such long hours. It is really challenging. You are learning the next day's lines while you are shooting today's scenes. I found courage I never realised I had. I hope to do more.;Sharon Stone;hope
The only thing I hope I did was never put in question my love for the game, or my passion to be counted on when it mattered most.;Curt Schilling;hope

I'm a vegetarian and very much active in regards to how I feel about animal rights and protecting animals and giving animals a voice.

I hope SeaWorld is exploring how, like Ringling, it can get out of the wild animal business.;Ingrid Newkirk;hope

You know, in my hometown of Hope, Arkansas, the three sacred heroes were Jesus, Elvis, and FDR, not necessarily in that order.;Mike Huckabee;hope
It's true that General Musharraf opposes my return, seeing me as a symbol of democracy in the country. He is comfortable with dictatorship. I hope better sense prevails.;Benazir Bhutto;hope

The myth of the liberal media empowers conservatives to control debate in the United States to the point where liberals cannot even hope for a fair shake anymore.;Eric Alterman;hope

I have taken this step because I want the discipline, the fire and the authority of the Church. I am hopelessly unworthy of it, but I hope to become worthy.;Edith Sitwell;hope

What you hope for, like Unforgiven did a lot to give you a chance to do it again sometime.;Lawrence Kasdan;hope

Hope is a risk that must be run.;Georges Bernanos;hope
I'm moving on. I should have made that clear when I made the announcement. I guess I wasn't clear. If people think you're leaving a show after all these years, you might be retiring. So I understand where they're coming from, but I should have impressed the fact that I hope I'm just moving on right now.;Regis Philbin;hope
I try and reduce myself to an almost blank slate and hope to God that I am creative.;Ben Kingsley;hope

I hope to keep entertaining in some way until I can't physically entertain any longer. It's what I was born to do, and I love this profession.;Bette Midler;hope
Jake Roberts has a hard enough time being Jake Roberts. The truth is a brutal thing, I just hope that the kids take the time to learn about each of the wrestlers in the game, and if the kids can learn from our mistakes, that would make me a happy man.;Jake Roberts;hope
You can always get the truth from an American statesman after he has turned seventy, or given up all hope of the Presidency.;Wendell Phillips;hope

White actors still get way more money in Hollywood. It's been that way for a very long time. I hope it'll change, but it's a matter of forcing that change.;Idris Elba;hope
I hope girls read what I say in interviews - they should just be themselves.;Taylor Momsen;hope

I hope to make a positive, productive contribution, as cheesy as that may sound.;Chelsea Clinton;hope
'Little Miss Sunshine' snowballed. It was a tiny movie. We shot it in 30 days, and it was really fun to do, but it was one of those small movies that you don't hold out huge hope for.;Greg Kinnear;hope
The London games mark the 24th anniversary of my winning two golds and setting the world record in the heptathlon. Someone is going to want it records are made to be broken - it's only a matter of time. I hope mine will outlive me.;Jackie Joyner-Kersee;hope
My denial and irresponsible attitude about asthma put me at great risk and caused me so much needless suffering. My hope is that the kids I talk to learn to open up about their asthma, become educated about their condition, and seek help.;Jackie Joyner-Kersee;hope
The 2012 London Olympic Games fostered a generation of hope. I witnessed women participating for the very first time, representing every nation.;Jackie Joyner-Kersee;hope
I remember thinking, That's what I need - and that hope was in Jesus Christ.;Willie Aames;hope

Hope thou not much, and fear thou not at all.;Algernon Charles Swinburne;hope

Hope springs eternal, even in politics.;Gwen Ifill;hope
When I was a kid, my father didn't really have much hope for me. He thought I was a dreamer he didn't think I would amount to anything. My mother also.;Frank Gehry;hope
I don't remember deciding to become a writer. You decide to become a dentist or a postman. For me, writing is like being gay. You finally admit that this is who you are, you come out and hope that no one runs away.;Mark Haddon;hope
Before I do a play I say that I hope it's going to be for as short a time as possible but, once you do it, it is a paradoxical pleasure. One evening out of two there are five minutes of a miracle and for those five minutes you want to do it again and again. It's like a drug.;Isabelle Huppert;hope
I hope that I would be considered romantic. I don't know... one of my favorite movies is 'The Notebook' so I guess that would be considered romantic. But I think being romantic is more than the flowers and the gifts. It's about connecting with the person and being able to talk and share things with her.;Taylor Lautner;hope
I'm thrilled to continue my partnership with U by Kotex for Generation Know while helping to empower girls. I've always been a motivational resource for my younger sisters and hope I can positively impact and inspire other young girls too.;Khloe Kardashian;hope

I do hope that our spring will be starting shortly and we will all be able to enjoy some sunshine again.;Lesley Garrett;hope
There are no ideas in the Republican Party right now in the Congress. They're the party of no. They desperately need some intellectual leadership. And whatever you think of Newt Gingrich, he can supply intellectual leadership. So I hope he does run.;Howard Dean;hope
Families are the tie that reminds us of yesterday, provide strength and support today, and give us hope for tomorrow. No government, no matter how well-intentioned, or well-managed, can provide what our families provide.;Bill Owens;hope
I hope that at the end of the seven years, people will say that I have been of some inspirational value to them at home in terms of inclusiveness and abroad, I look forward to representing Ireland.;Michael D. Higgins;hope

I hope that it can relate to and be a blessing to anybody, with the hope that someday they will find Jesus Christ to be the same God that I've found Him to be.;Jonny Lang;hope

I hope I never get so old I get religious.;Ingmar Bergman;hope
We're in an emergency situation. The United States has become an absolutely terrifying country, and I would hope that I could participate in some way in stopping the horror and the brutality.;Wallace Shawn;hope
But because we've all been readers, we know what the experience is like, and we hope that what certain writers have given to us, we will give to someone.;Wallace Shawn;hope
I really subscribe to that old adage that you should never let the audience get ahead of you for a second. So if the film's abrasive and wrongfoots people then, y'know, that's great. But I hope it involves an audience.;Paul Thomas Anderson;hope
I hope that just what I sing about and how I relate to my audience is as much of a political statement as I need to make.;Dave Matthews;hope
We need international support so that our people live a life of normality, of dignity, of liberty and freedom. I hope that our cry for freedom may be heard.;Mahmoud Abbas;hope

Well I certainly have learned and I hope I'm moving on and certainly two years of prison was a terrible punishment.;Jeffrey Archer;hope
You travel with the hope that something unexpected will happen. It has to do with enjoying being lost and figuring it out and the satisfaction.

Well, you know, the definition of second marriage is the triumph of hope over experience.;George Will;hope

The comfortable estate of widowhood is the only hope that keeps up a wife's spirits.;John Gay;hope
Whatever I do, I hope it's quality, I hope it's something that's class.;Garth Brooks;hope
In live action movies, you just hope that everything works. Because the actor may had a bad morning and doesn't play good, or accidents happen continuously. Many things contradict what you are trying to say. But in cartoons, nothing contradict what you want to say.;John Hench;hope
Even if I went off to some other career, I hope I would still be doing Coen films.;Carter Burwell;hope
My great hope would be that Quebec would realize itself fully as a distinct part of Canada, and stay Canadian, bringing to Canada a part of its richness.;Gabrielle Roy;hope

I hope that my government can help change Italian mentality.;Mario Monti;hope
Access to books and the encouragement of the habit of reading: these two things are the first and most necessary steps in education and librarians, teachers and parents all over the country know it. It is our children's right and it is also our best hope and their best hope for the future.;Michael Morpurgo;hope
I hope I'm in a position to make stuff that I really want to make as opposed to stuff that I just have to make for money reasons, or to sustain a certain marquee value.;Paul Walker;hope
Wherever my story takes me, however dark and difficult the theme, there is always some hope and redemption, not because readers like happy endings, but because I am an optimist at heart. I know the sun will rise in the morning, that there is a light at the end of every tunnel.;Michael Morpurgo;hope
Next year, I hope there will be even more parties, lots of holidays and just having a good time, really. Plus wing-walking, air shows and learning to fly, as they are all things I want to do. I won't be restricted by age.;Carol Vorderman;hope
I think if there's a great depression there might be some hope.;Lawrence Ferlinghetti;hope
I'm terrible as I never take my make-up off at night, which I know is really dreadful. Whenever I'm out partying I just can't be bothered and now I am on 'Loose Women' that tends to be all the time. I hope next year holds even more parties for me.;Carol Vorderman;hope
You learn timing on the road. You learn structure and how to read an audience. You learn so much about the business of laughter that you can't learn on a set, because it's all on you. Sometimes you bomb, and you know not to tell that joke again... You just hope people find the humor in the awkwardness.;Marlon Wayans;hope
I hope to make acting my career for the rest of my life, if I can.;Chloe Moretz;hope
My greatest desire is that the hope that has overcome fear in my country will help vanquish it around the world.;Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva;hope

I hope to focus on what I'm passionate about because I think I'd do them best job on them - education, urban education, women and children's issues and literacy.;Jenna Bush;hope
No, I am not a homosexual. If I were a homosexual, I would hope I would have the courage to say so. What's cruel is that you are forcing me to say I am not a homosexual. This means you are putting homosexuals down. I don't want to do that.;Ed Koch;hope
I hope to continue writing. I hope to continue teaching.;Jenna Bush;hope
I hope we don't get to the point where we have to have the cat stop chasing the mouse to teach him glassblowing and basket weaving.;Joseph Barbera;hope
I hope to work with kids any way possible.;Jenna Bush;hope
People are rapidly losing hope and trust. They believe their government has been captured by special interests and no longer cares about them, and they are right.;Marcy Kaptur;hope
The way you deal with a scare is the way you deal with a laugh. The timing has to be perfect. When you're dealing with fear or laughter - emotions that happen spontaneously - you hope it's working. But in the moment, you really have no idea.;Patrick Wilson;hope
My object will be, if possible, to form Christian men, for Christian boys I can scarcely hope to make.;Thomas Arnold;hope
It is in vain to hope to please all alike. Let a man stand with his face in what direction he will, he must necessarily turn his back on one half of the world.;George Dennison Prentice;hope
When they see those fourteen lights, they're looking at a miracle. And deep down, they feel that whatever's going to happen, there will be someone there to help them. And that fills them with hope.;M. Night Shyamalan;hope
If you live through the initial stage of fame and get past it, and remember thats not who you are. If you live past that, then you have a hope of maybe learning how to spell the word artist.;Patrick Swayze;hope
Being insecure - I'm a master, a virtuoso - they can be handing me the keys to the kingdom and all I can think is, I hope I don't drop the key.;M. Night Shyamalan;hope
We go through the whole season working on next season's car and developing the car and making sure we fit in the car and all that sort of stuff. And we obviously give ideas of what we would hope next year's car would have even if it's small things like buttons on the steering wheel and different positions and whatever.;Jenson Button;hope
My hope is that we will turn Greece into maybe the most transparent country in the world with everything on the web.;George Papandreou;hope
We love a good, hyped sound, but when it starts to sound insincere, that's when I lose interest. I hope that our music, even if it sounds polished, doesn't sound insincere.;Nate Ruess;hope
I am not the same man I was 35 years ago. And I hope that five years and ten years from now, I'll be a better man, a more mature man, a wiser man, a more humble man and a more spirited man to serve the good of my people and the good of humanity.;Louis Farrakhan;hope
Take hope from the heart of man and you make him a beast of prey.;Ouida;hope
I think as a rifle platoon and company commander your view is about 1,000 meters in front of you and you hope you can cover that ground and not have to back up and give it up again.;Oliver North;hope
You don't know what someone's going to walk away from a movie with, but you hope it's something positive, but if nothing, you want them most basically to be entertained and engaged. That's your job. But you also hope to give them something to chew on or maybe some insight into the human existence, you hope a little bit. Not to sound too lofty.;Melissa Rosenberg;hope
Our only hope is to control the vote.;Medgar Evers;hope
We need to recognise that the whole edifice of our fifth estate, of our journalism, has been built on a foundation of newspaper journalism and that that foundation is crumbling. The management of the media companies will deny that the end is nigh. I hope they are right.;Malcolm Turnbull;hope
I've had nine of my books adapted to film, and almost all were enjoyable. I've been very lucky with Hollywood, and look forward to more movies being adapted. But I don't get involved in that process. I know nothing about making movies and I stay away from it and hope for the best.;John Grisham;hope
I hope that we can continue this cooperation on other critical issues related to America's future technological competitiveness. We must work together to encourage the creative talents that have made our country the world leader in technology.;Dan Lipinski;hope
As the war on terror continues, Americans must honor the brave men and women who gave their lives for the protection of this nation and the hope of peace.;Dan Lipinski;hope
There is a part of me that still wants to go out and grab a backpack and unplug - not take a cellphone or even a camera and just get out there and experience the world and travel. I have yet to do that, but someday I hope.;Emilio Estevez;hope
I hope America can also be the cultural leader of the world, and use this frontier spirit to lead and show others that we need courage to go places where we have not gone before.;Tadao Ando;hope
I hope that America as a whole, and especially its architects, will become more seriously involved in producing a new architectural culture that would bring the nation to the apex - where it has stood before - and lead the world.;Tadao Ando;hope
I hope to stay on 'Glee,' I hope to still be a 'Housewife' and I hope to do 'The New Normal.' I just want to do it all! Why not? I'm only going to be young for a little while longer.;NeNe Leakes;hope
I'm Method trained. How is this character like me? What does she think of her mother? What does her mother think of her? It's like construction, and then, yes, you hope you're talented and that the universe aligns and captures the kind of laborer's work you've done and whatever else sprinkles down on you, and it's all caught on film or onstage.;Ellen Barkin;hope
I really hope that we'll have a sustainable future on this planet, I really do. So I probably geek out mostly about learning more about how potentially we can hopefully make that happen, hopefully we're not too far lost.;Ellen Page;hope
To me, what I love about the draft is first, you see the young men who are realizing their dreams that they've worked so hard for. That's a pretty cool thing. You saw the emotion from some of these guys the other day. And then, the second thing is this total sense of hope and optimism. And, I think that's great for everybody.;Roger Goodell;hope
Gabriel Byrne is an extraordinary human being. We have two extraordinary kids and we work at it. We were always friends. He stuck by me through very hard times, and I hope he'd say the same about me.;Ellen Barkin;hope
It's a pity that the tennis is really going down the drain. Every year it's getting worse and worse and worse. There has to be a radical change, and I hope it will be really soon.;Marat Safin;hope
The one thing I would hope would go on my tombstone is, 'I made my parents proud.';Roger Goodell;hope
President Obama chose politics over leadership. 'Hope' and 'Change' have become bait-and-switch.;Lindsey Graham;hope
I'd die if I was Madonna. I'd die. God, what a horrible way to live. And Michael Jackson! To be so famous and to feel so isolated. I feel so bad for them. I don't know how it feels, and I hope it never happens to me.;Alicia Silverstone;hope
It's a different outlook, and one that I understand. When you are a former member of the Warsaw Pact, when you have lived behind the Berlin Wall, when you have experienced the communist systems that existed in these countries, for them, the West represents hope.;Jean-Pierre Raffarin;hope
I tried to use words that were dealing with the emotional quality that any human being could recognize in the way that they felt about their country. It's to do with the world we live in. That world is a brutal one and full of war. It's also full of many wonderful things and love and hope.;P. J. Harvey;hope
I think there's been a decline in the public's access to what's being done with their tax dollars, what's being done in their name. I hope that that will be repaired.;Bill Keller;hope
You know, this is a war of ideology, a war of thoughts and of faith. And we need people to really stand for faith and trust, not hope and change.;Sharron Angle;hope
I still have, I hope, a lot of years and there are still a lot of things I want to do.;Faye Dunaway;hope
Zhang Yimou tried to use martial arts to talk about Chinese culture, Chinese people. What do they think, what do they want and what do they hope.;Jet Li;hope
Writing a song is much like being an author. Yes, we all have tools to write (everyone has a brain I hope!), but that doesn't all of a sudden make us best selling authors.;Ken Hill;hope
I hope that my investment into Atomico will become my best financial investment to date.;Niklas Zennstrom;hope
Open markets offer the only realistic hope of pulling billions of people in developing countries out of abject poverty, while sustaining prosperity in the industrialized world.;Kofi Annan;hope
We need to keep hope alive and strive to do better.;Kofi Annan;hope
I am encouraged that there's going to be much better dialogue between the federal government and the state of Arizona. I mean, I hope that's not wishful thinking.;Jan Brewer;hope
So you know, I think that the federal government, the Democrats, and President Obama are selling a lot of hope and change, but no delivery of any of those promises.;Jan Brewer;hope
There's a lot of great people out here, I just appreciate it and hope everybody has had fun because I've enjoyed my ride.;Fuzzy Zoeller;hope
It is my fervent hope and prayer that by exposing my mistakes and by pointing out the things that were a part of my early life, some who might be following the same paths might not make those same mistakes.;John Clayton;hope
I hope everybody's had fun, because I've enjoyed my ride. I can tell you that. Now it's time to step aside and let some other young kid come in and win. Hopefully, they will, too.;Fuzzy Zoeller;hope

Women's humor seems to be a little more supportive. It's just kind of trying to make the other one laugh through funny voices and kind of talking about other people. I respond to that.

Humor helps ease the tension of race and the differences in society. If there wasn't comedy I don't know if Obama could have ever become president.;Marlon Wayans;humor

Colombian humor is very black, very sarcastic.;Barbet Schroeder;humor

Even celebrities, most people have a sense of humor. Most of the people we meet who we've done on the show, like it.;Matt Stone;humor

I think hip-hop does a very good job of infusing comedy and humor and wit into music, a lot more than other genres.;Carrie Brownstein;humor

Humor can inform and break down stigma, which is a huge issue in the military.;Garry Trudeau;humor

I appreciate humor so much, but I'm actually not a funny girl.;Emmanuelle Chriqui;humor
I suppose I look for humor in most situations because it humanizes things it makes a character much more three-dimensional if there's some kind of humor. Not necessarily laugh-out-loud type of stuff, just a sense that there is a humorous edge to things. I do like that.;Colm Meaney;humor

I'm not for gratuitous nudity, but if there's humor, I don't have a problem.;Rebecca Romijn;humor

I liked the humor of it, I've always enjoyed a sense of humor in God and in religion and in spirituality.;Amber Tamblyn;humor

The waltz is a very important part of my life. It's a very important way for me to express my positiveness, bringing humor to the world.;Andre Rieu;humor

But if you don't watch me, I will try and sneak in some humor. I see humor everywhere in life around me.;Marion Ross;humor

I am a great believer that what makes our show different is the humor.;Treat Williams;humor
Humor that is edgy is never squeaky clean.;Jeff Ross;humor

Humor has always been important to me. If there is a shield of faith that you can keep up against difficulties, humor is the Teflon coating.;Laurel Lee;humor
He has such a patronizing tone and manner, and such a sarcastic sense of humor. I found him rather brutal, a kind of elegant brutality which appealed. No, I think he came pretty much off the page.;Jeremy Northam;humor
I think I'm too cynical for L.A. My sense of humor doesn't go down well here, which probably affects my love life. I need to have a laugh track following me around so people know I'm trying to be funny.;Teddy Thompson;humor

So to be comic-ized, yeah, that's cool.;Nathan Fillion;imagination

I still have a photo on my wall of the greatest idol I will ever have in my life, and it's myself at eight.

That was me at my best.;Henning Mankell;imagination
I like something where I can really use my imagination and be an active participant in the construction of the monster and usually that's in the world of the supernatural or the world of the fantastic, so that's why those kinds of stories about demons and the supernatural appeal to me or maybe I'm really interested in that subject.;Sam Raimi;imagination

Only in your imagination can you revise.;Fay Wray;imagination
It's a great excuse and luxury, having a job and blaming it for your inability to do your own art.

A place makes a deep impression on you when you're young. It lives with you. It's like your childhood. It fertilises the imagination.;Richard Eyre;imagination
For some reason I can't explain, artist and musicians tend to look younger than our age.

The artist must bow to the monster of his own imagination.;Richard Wright;imagination

Well, I think that - I think leadership's always been about two main things: imagination and courage.;Paul Keating;imagination

Improving our national intelligence capabilities should remain a top priority and a continual process.;Blanche Lincoln;intelligence
The war on terror, I believe, will be waged by effective intelligence and police work and cruise missiles.;Michael Mandelbaum;intelligence

It is difficult, if not impossible, to argue that laws written in the 1970s are adequate for today's intelligence challenges.;Bob Barr;intelligence
Prince Charles is an absolute Mountbatten. The real intelligence in the royal family comes through my parents to Prince Philip and the children.;Lord Mountbatten;intelligence

We can't gather the intelligence we need to foil future attacks, if we are blindly granting terrorists the right to remain silent. But for some reason, we've already done that - with the terrorist who tried to bring down Flight 253.;Peter King;intelligence
Everyone I know who used to be in the intelligence community is moving into the corporate world.;Tony Gilroy;intelligence
I do not - I never believed it's better to kill a terrorist than to detain him. We want to detain as many terrorists as possible so we can elicit the intelligence from them in the appropriate manner so that we can disrupt follow-on terrorist attacks.;John O. Brennan;intelligence
The actions that we take on the counterterrorism front, again, are to take actions against individuals where we believe that the intelligence base is so strong and the nature of the threat is so grave and serious, as well as imminent, that we have no recourse except to take this action that may involve a lethal strike.;John O. Brennan;intelligence
We are in this business, whether it be intelligence or the government, to protect freedom, democracy and liberty, not to violate that.;John O. Brennan;intelligence
I will not, nor will I ever, publicly divulge sensitive intelligence sources and methods. For when that happens, our national security is endangered and lives can be lost.;John O. Brennan;intelligence
As a former career intelligence professional, I have a profound appreciation for the value of intelligence. Intelligence disrupts terrorist plots and thwarts attacks. Intelligence saves lives.;John O. Brennan;intelligence

But some actors I have met possess an intelligence that I can only dream of. It's about character, it's about behavior. They understand things about people that I simply don't see.;Ron Silver;intelligence
When I was the director of Central Intelligence in the early '90s, I tried to get the Air Force to partner with us in building drones. And they didn't want to, because they had no pilots.;Robert M. Gates;intelligence
But it is equally incontrovertible that if our intelligence gathering process is seriously flawed, we had better find out and find out fast if we are to avoid another Sept. 11.;Adam Schiff;intelligence
The prompt assimilation of that intelligence will be essential if we are to avoid another September 11th.;Adam Schiff;intelligence

The Patriot Act removed major legal barriers that prevented the law enforcement, intelligence, and national defense communities from talking and coordinating their work to protect the American people and our national security.;Jon Porter;intelligence

People's intelligence tends to be in inverse proportion to their number. People don't tend to get smarter as they get into bigger groups.;Robyn Hitchcock;intelligence

I have had national security background, 10 years on the Intelligence Committee, the last two years as chair.;Bob Graham;intelligence

We need to make a greater investment in human intelligence.;Bob Graham;intelligence
During the Cold War, we gathered information by listening to the Soviets, taking pictures of the Soviets, and we allowed our human intelligence to decline.;Bob Graham;intelligence
This president has been reluctant to hold anybody accountable. No one was held accountable after September the 11th. Nobody's been held accountable after the clear flaws in intelligence leading up to the war in Iraq.;Bob Graham;intelligence
In reality, serial killers are of average intelligence.;Pat Brown;intelligence
The PATRIOT Act brought down the wall separating intelligence agencies from law enforcement and other entities charged with protecting the Nation from terrorism.;Chris Chocola;intelligence

George Tenet has been the director of central intelligence since 1997, time enough to have changed the Agency's culture. He has failed. He should go.;Richard Perle;intelligence

How can faceless bureaucrats in an intelligence agency deny brave soldiers a chance to tell the truth?;Curt Weldon;intelligence

I'm much better informed than Mr. Clarke ever was about the nature of the intelligence that was available again Osama bin Laden and which was consistently denigrated by himself and Mr. Tenet.;Michael Scheuer;intelligence
The 'Robben Island Bible' has arrived at the British Museum. It's a garish thing, its cover plastered with pink and gold Hindu images, designed to hide its contents. Within is the finest collection of words generated by human intelligence: the complete works of William Shakespeare.;Daniel Hannan;intelligence
Someday we'll learn the whole story of why George W. Bush brushed off that intelligence briefing of Aug. 6, 2001, 'Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.' But surely a big distraction was the major speech he was readying for delivery on Aug. 9, his first prime-time address to the nation.;Frank Rich;intelligence

The intelligence failures with respect to Iraq were massive and have damaged our credibility around the world.;Carl Levin;intelligence
When a decision is made to go to war based on intelligence, it is a fateful decision. It has ramifications and impacts way beyond the current months and years.;Carl Levin;intelligence

I am committed to ensure that our intelligence community, law enforcement, medical professionals, and military have the information and funding needed to protect the American people from threats at home and abroad.;Leonard Boswell;intelligence
The 9/11 Commission strongly recommends that the National Intelligence Director be fully in control of the budget, from developing it to implementing it, to ensuring that the National Intelligence Director has the clout to make decisions.;Leonard Boswell;intelligence
The National Intelligence Director needs the authority to do the job we are asking him to do. That means power over the intelligence budget. And to be effective, to be allowed to do his or her job, they must have authority over the budget.;Leonard Boswell;intelligence
I mean enormous pressure was brought to bear - Valerie Amos, Lady Amos, went round Africa with people from our intelligence services trying to press them. I had to make sure that we didn't promise a misuse of aid in a way that would be illegal.;Clare Short;intelligence

Policymakers have to make judgments based on the best intelligence they get.;Frank Carlucci;intelligence
My understanding is that what was provided was general order of battle information, not operational intelligence. I certainly have no knowledge of US participation in preparing battle and strike packages and doubt strongly that that occurred.;Frank Carlucci;intelligence
I can remember when I was National Security Adviser, the intelligence community told us... they put out an intelligence report saying that Iran would never back off from attacks on shipping in the Gulf if we use force.;Frank Carlucci;intelligence

Advertising must respect the intelligence of its audience and if it does not prompt them to think, it will be instantly dismissed.;Maurice Saatchi;intelligence

We have killed or captured dozens of members of al Qaeda and the Taliban. Our military and intelligence forces are working both hard and smart.;Marsha Blackburn;intelligence

The people who work in intelligence work are more conscious, more apt to be attentive.;William Hedgcock Webster;intelligence

I refuse to be molded into some stereotypical ballplayer that has no interests, really, no life, no depth, no intelligence.;Barry Zito;intelligence
So that, to me, is important that audiences are treated with an amount of respect toward their intelligence. Most Hollywood films don't respect their intelligence.;Eriq La Salle;intelligence
Intelligence is our first line of defense against terrorism, and we must improve the collection capabilities and analysis of intelligence to protect the security of the United States and its allies.;Saxby Chambliss;intelligence
The security of the United States, which is so dependent on having accurate and timely intelligence, is not a Republican or a Democratic issue.;Saxby Chambliss;intelligence

We have three centers: the emotional center, the intellectual center, and the physical body center. Each one of them has its own intelligence. How much better would we be if all three were working in unison?;Erin Gray;intelligence

Women have talent and intelligence but, due to social constraints and prejudices, it is still a long distance away from the goal of gender equality.;Pratibha Patil;intelligence
Well, our position, and our chairman has talked about this extensively, is that we had a lot of intelligence prior to 9/11. We knew that two al Qaeda operatives who ultimately participated in the 9/11 disaster were in the United States. We didn't find them.;Richard Ben-Veniste;intelligence
Dissents are appeals to the brooding spirit of the law, to the intelligence of another day.;Charles Evans Hughes;intelligence

In other cases, when the medium becomes entranced, the demonstration of a communicator's separate intelligence may become stronger and the sophistication less.;Oliver Joseph Lodge;intelligence

Rehearsals and this band are two words that don't really go together, kinda like Military Intelligence.;Jerry Cantrell;intelligence

As a nation we have, over the past seven years, been rebuilding our intelligence with powerful capabilities that many thought we would no longer need after the Cold War. We have been rebuilding our clandestine service, our satellite and other technical collection, our analytical depth and expertise.;George Tenet;intelligence
To understand a difficult topic like Iraq takes patience and care. Unfortunately, you rarely hear a patient, careful or thoughtful discussion of intelligence these days.;George Tenet;intelligence
By definition, intelligence deals with the unclear, the unknown, the deliberately hidden. What the enemies of the United States hope to deny we work to reveal.;George Tenet;intelligence
When I came to the CIA in the mid-'90s, our graduating class of case officers was unbelievably low. Now, after years of rebuilding, our training programs and putting our best efforts to recruit the most talented men and women, we are graduating more clandestine officers than at any time in the history of the Central Intelligence Agency.;George Tenet;intelligence

All of these priorities are interconnected and are vital to TSA's mission - and I would say, all of our collective mission.;John Pistole;intelligence
The reason we are doing these types of pat downs and using the advanced imagery technology is trying to take the latest intelligence and how we know al Qaeda and affiliates want to hurt us, they want to bring down whether it is passenger air craft or cargo aircraft.;John Pistole;intelligence
So, you know, I think that Democrats are being more successful in Congress and I'm really going to be proud of the role I will play tomorrow as ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee when this bill passes.;Jane Harman;intelligence

I certainly believe that improving our intelligence is of important national interest.;Jeff Sessions;intelligence
Making use of human weaknesses in intelligence work is a logical matter. It keeps coming up, and of course you try to look at all the aspects that interest you in a human being.;Markus Wolf;intelligence
I feel that I, and the people under my command, tried to use all the traditional methods of recruiting agents which were also used by other intelligence services adopting also means like pressure, money, sex - but that did not characterize my service.;Markus Wolf;intelligence
I'm inspired by the sheer ingenuity and intelligence possessed by my fellow band mates.;Brad Delson;intelligence
If you look at the publishers I've worked with, generally, they're a great bunch. Creation is unlike any other publishing house you can think of. The people I've worked with have integrity and intelligence and, almost always, less money than ideas.;Peter Sotos;intelligence
The terrorist uses surprise and stealth, and the only way to defeat that is by having accurate and timely intelligence.;Bill Nelson;intelligence

And I understand that, I testified in closed hearings over eight years because there are intelligence matters, there are sensitive matters that should not be held in a public hearing.;Louis Freeh;intelligence

I spend so much time with the brightest and most talented and well-rounded people.

It is simply a fact that the birth rate of our illegal immigrants exceeds that of our legal residents.;John Linder;legal

The Republican Party looks at massive immigration, legal and illegal, as a source of cheap labor, satisfying a very important constituency.;Tom Tancredo;legal
They view massive immigration as a massive infusion of potential voters for the Democratic Party, and therefore will do nothing, absolutely nothing to stop that flow of legal or illegal entrance into the country.;Tom Tancredo;legal
They seem to have forgotten that, and are back saying the only purpose of P2P networks is for illegal trading of owned goods. We claim part of the reason for P2P is for legal trading of what ought to be in public domain. And what is in public domain in many cases.;John Perry Barlow;legal

The people and the mindset that killed 3,000 of our fellow citizens on September 11 2001, would have killed not 3,000, but 300,000 if they could have or 3 million or 30 million. We need to do everything we can within our value systems and legal structures to make sure that doesn't happen.;Tim Pawlenty;legal
The only people that should vote should be legal.;Pam Bondi;legal
Truly I never thought of myself as writing legal thrillers, and I still don't think I do. I write stories about women.;Lisa Scottoline;legal
